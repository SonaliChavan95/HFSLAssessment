rose 8% in September, signalling a cautious attitude and
preference for cash amid the uncertainty caused by the
coronavirus crisis, Italian banking lobby ABI said on Tuesday.
    In its monthly report, ABI said that deposits from
households and businesses rose by 125 billion euros ($147.7
billion) year-on-year in September after a 7% increase the
previous month.
    The increase in deposits was particularly marked for
companies and could be a result of the money that companies have
obtained through state-guaranteed loans that in part is parked
as deposits at banks, waiting to be used, ABI Deputy Director
General Gianfranco Torriero said.
    Speaking during a conference call Torriero added that the
ongoing second wave of the health emergency made it even more
necessary for government measures to support businesses to be
confirmed. 
    Data for September also showed a continuous growth in
lending to households and businesses, up 4.8% in September.

    * Red carpet for team cementing normalisation deal
    * PLO fear visit will encourage Israel to annex West Bank

 (Corrects Mnuchin quote, paragraph 15)
    By Stephen Farrell and Dan Williams
    JERUSALEM, Oct 20 (Reuters) - In an historic first visit by
a Gulf Arab nation, a United Arab Emirates delegation arrived in
Israel on Tuesday, accompanied by top U.S. officials, to cement
a normalisation deal signed last month.
    The UAE and Gulf neighbour Bahrain became the first Arab
states in a quarter of a century to sign deals to establish
formal ties with Israel despite ongoing differences over the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
    The deals, forged largely over shared fears of Iran, were
brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of next month's
U.S. presidential election.
    ""We are making history in a way that will stand for
generations,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in
welcoming Emirati Economy Minister Abdullah bin Touq al-Mari and
Minister of State for Financial Affairs Obaid Humaid al-Tayer.
    They were accompanied by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin and other American officials on the flight from Abu
Dhabi to Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.
    ""I think that the visit of such a high level delegation from
the UAE... will show our peoples, the region and the entire
world the benefit of having friendly, peaceful and normal
exchanges,"" Netanyahu said.
    Four agreements were signed – relating to investment,
scientific cooperation, civil aviation and visa exemptions
during the visit, which was restricted to the airport due to
coronavirus concerns.
    Tayer said the deals offered ""great opportunities"" to
""achieve prosperity for both our ecnomies, and our people"".
    Citing discussions on taxation and financial relations, he
said there had already been significant progress between the two
governments and added: ""We look forward to welcoming you to the
UAE in the near future.""
        
    PALESTINIAN ANGER
    Washington and its allies have said the deals would foster
regional peace and stability. But they have prompted anger from
the Palestinians.
    Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Executive Committee of
the Palestine Liberation Organization said Tuesday's UAE  visit
came amid Israeli settlement expansion and was ""shameful"".
    ""The bilateral agreements that were announced today and the
delegations that come and go, all of that offers the occupation
a strength to escalate its aggression and its crimes against the
Palestinian people and increases its intransigence and
arrogance,"" he said in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank.
    In Gaza, Hazem Qassem, a spokesman for the Islamist group
Hamas, said: ""Such a visit will only encourage the occupation to
pursue the gradual annexation of West Bank lands.""
    Mnuchin, the most senior U.S. official to attend, called it
an ""historic occasion,"" adding: ""With greater economic
prosperity comes stronger security.""
    Reflecting a realignment of regional powers concerned about
Iran, he added that Israel, the UAE and USA ""share a similar
outlook regarding threats and opportunities in the region.""
    Another U.S. official in attendance, International
Development Finance Corporation head Adam Boehler, said the
three countries would set up a fund, initially projected to
raise $3 billion, to encourage private-sector investment and
regional cooperation.
    He said he envisaged funding to enable the modernisation of
Israeli-operated checkpoints for Palestinians.
    The U.S. officials had on Sunday joined an Israeli
delegation to Bahrain for a signing ceremony to formalise ties.
    Israel and the UAE have already signed several commercial
deals since mid-August, when they first announced they would
establish full relations.
