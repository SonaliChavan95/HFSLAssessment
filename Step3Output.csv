    Oct 19 (Reuters) - Passengers travelling to Hong Kong and
Italy from Britain's Heathrow Airport will undergo a one-hour
coronavirus test before flying out of the United Kingdom under
plans to open up international travel, The Times reported on
Tuesday. 
    Rapid tests will be introduced from Tuesday at Heathrow
Airport to allow travellers to enter countries where a negative
COVID-19 test result is needed to skip quarantine, the newspaper
https://bit.ly/3dFJxwp said. 
    Passengers require to book a test in advance at a cost of 80
pounds ($103), The Times said. 
    Heathrow Airport did not immediately respond when contacted
by Reuters. 
    Aviation services firms Collinson and Swissport have set up
rapid testing facilities for outbound passengers at Heathrow,
the newspaper said.
    The testing facilities will initially be open for four weeks
and could be extended depending on passenger demand, the report
added.
    Both Collinson and Swissport did not immediately respond
when Reuters contacted early on Tuesday. 
    Airlines including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and
Cathay Pacific <0293.HK> are among the first to be offering the
facility to passengers in Terminals 2 and 5, Financial Times https://on.ft.com/37k42xy
 reported.
    Meanwhile, British Transport Minister Grant Shapps said on
Monday that he would push for an agreement on new travel
corridors with the United States. [nL8N2HA2FR]

    By Roslan Khasawneh
    SINGAPORE, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Singapore has suspended the
licences to sell ship fuel held by a subsidiary of defunct oil
trader Hin Leong Trading Pte Ltd since it could no longer meet
the licensing requirements, the Maritime and Port Authority of
Singapore (MPA) said on Monday. 
    The MPA suspended the licences for Hin Leong's subsidiary
Ocean Bunkering Services Pte Ltd (OBS), an agency spokesperson
said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters sent on
Oct. 12.
    MPA typically issues licences to supply bunker, or ship,
fuel to vessels and to operate barges to transport the fuel to
the ships. 
    ""Given that OBS has stopped its bunkering operations since
April this year and has not been able to fulfil its licensing
commitment to date, MPA has suspended their bunkering licences
until further notice,"" MPA said. The agency did not specify the
exact date the licences were suspended.
    In 2019, OBS was the third-largest bunker fuel supplier by
volume in Singapore, which is the world's biggest bunkering hub
with about 50 million tonnes of annual sales volumes. 
    Hin Leong's other bunker supply unit, Hin Leong Marine
International Pte Ltd, was still listed as a licensed bunkering
supplier while OBS's licences were listed as suspended, the
latest data on the MPA's website as of Oct. 9 showed.  
    OBS informed customers in April it would suspend marine fuel
deliveries after lenders pulled credit lines to Hin Leong, which
at the time owed creditors $3.85 billion, amid allegations of
fraud and losses on oil trades as prices dropped because of the
spread of the coronavirus. [nL3N2C41U1] [nL3N2CC0UP]
    At the start of October, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Hin Leong's
court-appointed judicial managers, placed a notice in local
media for the sale of an ""independent bunker fuel and lubricant
supplier in Singapore."" [nL4N2GZ16J]
    OBS owns a fleet of 14 bunker barges licensed by the MPA,
according to the company's website. It supplied about 3 million
to 4 million tonnes of bunker fuel in 2019, according to
estimates by industry sources.

    By Florence Tan and Anshuman Daga
    SINGAPORE, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The court-appointed manager
for Ocean Tankers Pte Ltd has applied to the Singapore court to
return most of the ships the company manages to the shipowners,
as cash is running low and Ocean Tankers will not be able to
maintain the fleet, two sources with knowledge of the matter
told Reuters.
    If successful, the move will allow Ocean Tankers, the
chartering arm of embattled oil trader Hin Leong Pte Ltd, to
resume its cash-generating business such as its oil lubricants
business, for which a sales process is underway, the sources
said.
    Ocean Tankers, Hin Leong, Xihe Holdings and four special
purpose vehicles all owned by oil tycoon Oon Kuin Lim and his
son and daughter have been placed by the Singapore High Court
under judicial management for restructuring after Hin Leong
raked up nearly $4 billion of debt. [nL3N2CB0XA]
    Ocean Tankers is spending $540,000 a day to maintain around
150 vessels, the sources said, citing judicial manager EY's
update sent to creditors and other stakeholders last week. Ocean
Tankers had chartered these vessels, mostly owned by the Lim
family, before it ran into financial problems.
    EY estimated that ""by early November 2020, (Ocean Tankers)
will not have sufficient cash to continue maintaining the
vessels in the company's fleet and the operations of the
company's lube plant, storage and terminal business"", according
to the update, reviewed by Reuters.
    A spokeswoman for EY declined comment to Reuters, citing
client confidentiality. Hin Leong's judicial managers at
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the Lim family and their lawyer
also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    The vessels are incurring costs at a time when they are not
generating income, the sources said.
    ""The JMs are trying their best to preserve the oil
lubricants business,"" one of the sources said.
    According to the update, the Lim family was no longer
interested in restructuring Ocean Tankers because the judicial
managers of Hin Leong had sued the family.
    The Lim family had on Sept. 30 proposed that Ocean Tankers
""should be placed into liquidation instead"", the update said.

    By Jamie Freed
    SYDNEY, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Virgin Australia looks set to cut
basic fares and start charging fees for items like checked
baggage and food under new chief executive Jayne Hrdlicka,
prompting a wider industry shake-up as the country's airlines
reawaken from the coronavirus crisis.
    Virgin's shift from being a full-service carrier will also
mark the end of a decade-long arms race with Qantas Airways Ltd
<QAN.AX> for corporate travellers involving lavish airport
lounges, celebrity chefs and lie-flat business seats on longer
domestic flights.
    Unusually for airlines globally, both carriers include free
checked baggage allowances, free Wi-Fi and complimentary food
and drinks even in the cheapest economy class tickets on
domestic flights. 
    Virgin, which entered voluntary administration in April, is
repositioning itself in a mid-market spot under new owner Bain
Capital as it looks to weather ongoing low demand from the
pandemic. [nL4N2H54NR] 
    Company sources and industry experts said they expect
Hrdlicka will re-introduce fees the airline had cut when it went
upmarket under long-serving former chief executive John
Borghetti. 
    Unbundling, or charging fees for previously included
services like checked baggage, seat selection, Wi-Fi, food and
in-flight entertainment is a strategy that helps airlines
attract price conscious travellers with a low base fare while
allowing them to pay extra for chosen add-ons.
    This could become even more important post-pandemic due to
the economic downturn, analysts say, with Virgin's move
downmarket also opening options for Qantas to stop providing an
international-style business class service on transcontinental
flights and to consider charging for some add-ons on its
cheapest sale fares without losing customers.
    Corporate fares are more likely to be all-inclusive, but
Virgin plans to reduce its airport lounge network and will no
longer attempt to match Qantas' premium product when it unveils
its new offering in around two weeks, according to a company
source who said the details were not finalised. Virgin and Bain
declined to comment.
    ""I think at least it allows the optionality for Qantas to go
downmarket,"" said John Thomas, a Boston-based former senior
executive at Virgin who helped introduce baggage fees in the
United States more than a decade ago as an airline consultant. 
    ""You can take costs out, you can do some unbundling, but
that doesn't mean that you have got to unbundle all of your
passengers,"" he told Reuters. ""For your corporates and for your
business clients and your premium passengers, you can still keep
it as a bundled offering.""
    Virgin's fleet reduction under Bain will widen Qantas'
advantage in network size and flight frequency, which can be
even more important to corporate travellers than creature
comforts, said a Qantas source who was not authorised to speak
with media. Qantas declined to comment.
    
    VARYING FARE PACKAGES
    One potential model for Virgin's fare structure is Air New
Zealand Ltd <AIR.NZ>. For domestic flights and those to and from
Australia, it offers fare packages starting from a seat without
checked bags and rising to ""worksdeluxe"", including two checked
bags, food and seatback entertainment.
    ""That would allow Virgin to straddle both sides of the
divide,"" said Judson Rollins, managing partner of Auckland-based
consultancy Propel Aviation Solutions. 
    Hrdlicka, a former head of Qantas low-cost arm Jetstar, said
in 2015 that Virgin had lost customers to Jetstar when it
included baggage and food in its fares, because ticket prices
rose. 
    ""Virgin just became too expensive,"" she said at an aviation
summit.
    Tony Webber, a consultant and former Qantas chief economist,
said he expected both household and business customers would be
price sensitive for the next few years, meaning it made sense
for Virgin to gravitate more toward a Jetstar type of model.
    Jetstar earned nearly 24% of its revenue from add-ons in
2019, according to IdeaWorksCompany, the 10th highest proportion
among airlines globally and equating to $26.32 per passenger.

    HONG KONG, Oct 20 (Reuters) - China's top ride-hailing firm
Didi Chuxing is considering Hong Kong for a multibillion-dollar
initial public offering (IPO) next year, people with knowledge
of the matter said, rethinking previous aims to list in New York
amid rising Sino-U.S. tension.
    Didi, backed by technology investment giants SoftBank
<9984.T>, Alibaba <BABA.N> and Tencent <0700.HK>, has started
initial talks with investment banks for the long-awaited IPO,
according to three people. The people spoke on condition of
anonymity as the information, including the identity of the
banks, was private. 
    The people said the Beijing-based company is targeting a
valuation of more than $60 billion by the time of launching the
IPO, expected as soon as in the first half of 2021. Founded
eight years ago, Didi has begun generating healthy profit since
the second quarter of the year and some of its investors are now
keen to cash in, said one of the people.
    Didi did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for
comment.
    The IPO plan is at an early stage and could change due to
market conditions, the people cautioned. 
    Didi is also considering a new fundraising round ahead of
the IPO in a bid to boost its valuation, two of the people said.
In the private secondary market, some of its shares are trading
well below a valuation of $56 billion it reached in 2017. (https://tinyurl.com/y6ojxhpd)
    Didi had for years aimed for a U.S. IPO because of the
prestige of a New York listing, the presence of comparable peers
like Uber <UBER.N> and Lyft <LYFT.O> and a deeper capital pool,
according to two of the people.
    All three people said Didi has now opted to consider Hong
Kong amid deteriorating U.S.-China relations that have left tech
firms like TikTok owner ByteDance in the crosshairs, they said.
[nL5N2F030L]
    U.S.-listed Chinese companies now also face tightened
scrutiny and more strict audit requirements from U.S.
regulators.

in third-quarter core earnings, citing strict cost management
and improving market environment.
    Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) came in at 371
million Swiss francs ($408 million) in July-September, above the
283 million francs a year earlier, as sea freight, the largest
part of the group's business, rose 12% due to recovery of demand
from small- to mid-size enterprise customers and the increase in
imports to Europe and North America from Asia.

 (Adds Didi comment, listed comparable firms, HK IPO market)
    By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
    HONG KONG, Oct 20 (Reuters) - China's top ride-hailing firm
Didi Chuxing is considering Hong Kong for a multibillion-dollar
initial public offering (IPO) next year, people with knowledge
of the matter said, rethinking previous aims to list in New York
amid rising Sino-U.S. tension.
    Didi, backed by technology investment giants SoftBank
<9984.T>, Alibaba <BABA.N> and Tencent <0700.HK>, has started
initial talks with investment banks for the long-awaited IPO,
according to three people. The people spoke on condition of
anonymity as the information, including the identity of the
banks, was private. 
    The people said the Beijing-based company is targeting a
valuation of more than $60 billion by the time of launching the
IPO, expected as soon as in the first half of 2021. Founded
eight years ago, Didi has begun generating healthy profit since
the second quarter of the year and some of its investors are now
keen to cash in, said one of the people.
    Didi is also considering a new fundraising round ahead of
the IPO in a bid to boost its valuation, two of the people said.
In the private secondary market, some of its shares are trading
well below a valuation of $56 billion it reached in 2017. (https://tinyurl.com/y6ojxhpd)
    The new timetable for the IPO and the private fundraising
round ahead of the planned IPO have not been reported before.   
    Asked by Reuters to comment, Didi said it doesn't have any
""definitive"" IPO plan or timeline. 
    The people familiar with the matter cautioned the IPO plan
is at an early stage and could change due to market conditions. 
    Didi had for years aimed for a U.S. IPO because of the
prestige of a New York listing, the presence of comparable peers
like Uber <UBER.N> and Lyft <LYFT.O> and a deeper capital pool,
according to two of the people. 
    Uber and Didi have long-standing links: after waging an
expensive campaign to crack the Chinese market, Uber in 2016
sold its operation to Didi in exchange for a 17.5% stake in the
Chinese firm, which in turn made a $1 billion investment in
Uber.
    All three people familiar with the matter said Didi has now
opted to consider Hong Kong for the listing amid deteriorating
U.S.-China relations that have left tech firms like TikTok owner
ByteDance in the crosshairs. [nL5N2F030L]
    U.S.-listed Chinese companies now also face tightened
scrutiny and more strict audit requirements from U.S.
regulators.
    Uninspiring stock performances by Uber and Lyft have also
discouraged Didi from seeking a U.S. IPO, said two of the
people. Uber and Lyft are both trading below their IPO price,
with Lyft's shares slashed more than two-thirds in price since
listing.
    If completed, Didi's IPO would further burnish Hong Kong's
status as a global capital markets hub, with $28.8 billion worth
of IPOs and secondary listings carried out in the city over the
year to date, Refinitiv data showed.
    That helped Hong Kong grab the second spot in the global
stock exchange league table - after Nasdaq - despite the city
struggling with the economic fallout of the pandemic and
anti-government protests.

 (Updates to close)
    By Nikhil Subba
    Oct 20 (Reuters) - Australian shares closed lower on
Tuesday, weighed by miners and bank stocks, as surging
coronavirus cases in Europe raised the possibility of further
restrictions and stoked fears of an onerous global economic
recovery.
    The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> slid 0.7% to close at
6,184.60, marking its worst session since Oct. 2. The benchmark
gained 0.9% on Monday. 
    Italy approved the shutting of public squares from 9 p.m. 
and many regions in Spain tightened curbs as COVID-19 cases
spiked. Meanwhile, in Britain the government scientific adviser
said the country needs to impose a three-week period of national
lockdown. [nL8N2HA4ES] [nL8N2H90HJ] [nL8N2H90HJ]    
    ""The virus numbers are pointing to a second wave globally.
This may lead to more severe shutdowns and lower economic
activity,"" said Brad Smoling, managing director at Smoling
Stockbroking.
    Adding to market uncertainty, U.S. House Speaker said she
hoped that by the end of Tuesday there will be ""clarity"" on
whether a coronavirus stimulus bill can be passed before the
Nov. 3 presidential election. [nL1N2HA1X4]
    ""The U.S. stimulus talks are just about out of time. I now
believe that neither side wants to make a move before the
election outcome,"" Smoling said.
    The Australian financial index <.AXJO> fell 1.2%, weighed by
losses in the ""Big Four"" banks.
    Australia and New Zealand Banking Group <ANZ.AX>, National
Australia Bank <NAB.AX> Commonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX>
and Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX> fell between 1% and 1.4%.
    Miners <.AXMM> fell 1.1%, dragged down by losses in BHP
Group <BHP.AX> Rio Tinto <RIO.AX>.
    In a bright spot, technology stocks <.AXIJ> gained 1.7% and
closed at a record high, boosted by buy-now-pay-later firm
Afterpay's <APT.AX> near 6% gain after a partnership with
Westpac Banking <WBC.AX> to offer savings accounts. [nL4N2HA4AB]
    In New Zealand, the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index <.NZ50>  rose
0.62% to 12,462.1.
    Top gainers were Serko Ltd <SKO.NZ>, up 3.6%, followed by
Port of Tauranga Ltd <POT.NZ>, gaining 3.5%.

    DUBAI, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The first ever official United
Arab Emirates delegation to Israel took off on Tuesday as the
two countries look to broaden cooperation after normalising ties
last month under a U.S.-brokered accord, forged largely over
shared fears of Iran.
    An Etihad Airways plane carrying Emirati government
officials, with U.S. dignitaries accompanying them, left the UAE
capital Abu Dhabi, headed to Ben-Gurion Airport, according to
flight tracking website FlightRadar24.
    Israeli officials said the visit would be restricted to the
airport due to coronavirus concerns. 
    The UAE and fellow Gulf state Bahrain in September became
the first Arab states in a quarter of a century to sign deals to
establish formal ties with Israel, a move that Washington and
its allies have said would foster regional peace and stability
but which has been rejected by the Palestinians.
    The Emirati delegation is led by Economy Minister Abdullah
bin Touq al-Mari and Minister of State for Financial Affairs
Obaid Humaid al-Tayer, a UAE foreign ministry spokeswoman
tweeted.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Middle East envoy
Ari Berkowitz are joining them on the trip, after having
accompanied an Israeli delegation to Bahrain on Sunday for a
signing ceremony to formalise ties.
    Israel and the UAE have already signed several commercial
deals since mid-August, when they first announced they would
establish full relations.
    Israeli officials said the two sides were expected to sign a
mutual visa-exemption agreement - Israel's first with an Arab
country.

    Oct 20 (Reuters) - Swiss freight-forwarding group Kuehne und
Nagel International <KNIN.S> reported on Tuesday a
better-than-expected rise of 31% in third-quarter core earnings,
citing strict cost management and improving market environment.
    Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) came in at 371
million Swiss francs ($408 million), above the 283 million
francs a year earlier, as sea freight, the largest part of the
group's business, rose 12% due to a recovery of demand from
small- to mid-size enterprise customers and the increase in
imports to Europe and North America from Asia.
    ""With our motivated team, we are ready for further growth
together with our customers, especially in the pharma &
healthcare and e-commerce sectors,"" Chief Executive Detlef
Trefzger said.
    Bernstein analysts said the third-quarter EBIT was above
expectations, and the company is performing well during the
coronavirus crisis, especially in the core forwarding business
as tight transport capacity helps to earn money.
    Kuehne und Nagel's results follow positive developments
among peers, as Deutsche Post AG <DPWGn.DE> raised its outlook
for full-year operating profit, and FedEx Corp <FDX.N> beat
first-quarter expectations, both companies citing a strong rise
in shipments during the coronavirus pandemic. [nL8N2GY4GM]

around 700 jobs by March 2021 due to the impact of the corona

    In September, the company had announced statutory
cooperation negotiations to reduce up to 1,000 jobs but the
final number came down by 300 during talks with employee
representatives, it said.
    Finnair continues temporary layoffs impacting most of its
employees in Finland, it said.

talks with Meituan)
    By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
    HONG KONG, Oct 20 (Reuters) - China's top ride-hailing firm
Didi Chuxing is considering Hong Kong for a multibillion-dollar
initial public offering next year, dropping previous aims to
list in New York amid rising Sino-U.S. tension, people with
knowledge of the matter said.
    Didi, backed by technology investment giants SoftBank
<9984.T>, Alibaba <BABA.N> and Tencent <0700.HK>, has started
initial talks with investment banks for the long-awaited IPO,
according to three people. It's looking to formally appoint lead
banks for the float in the coming months, two of them said. 
    The people spoke on condition of anonymity as the
information, including the identity of the banks, was private. 
    The people said Didi is targeting a valuation of more than
$60 billion by the time of IPO launch, expected as soon as in
the first half of 2021. Founded eight years ago, Didi began
generating healthy profit in the second quarter this year and
some investors are now keen to cash in, said one of the people.
    Didi is also considering a new fundraising round ahead of
the IPO in a bid to boost its valuation, two of the people said.
In the private secondary market, some of its shares are trading
well below a valuation of $56 billion it reached in 2017. (https://tinyurl.com/y6ojxhpd)
    The new timetable for the IPO and the private fundraising
round ahead of it have not been reported before.    
    Asked by Reuters to comment, Didi said it doesn't have any
""definitive"" IPO plan or timeline. The people familiar with the
matter cautioned the IPO plan could change due to market
conditions. 
    The plan also comes after Didi walked away from talks on
merging with domestic rival Meituan <3690.HK>, according to four
separate sources, amid disagreement on the valuation of the
merged business and management lines. These four people declined
to be identified because the information was private. 
    Meituan declined to comment. Didi said it had not engaged in
any merger discussion with Meituan.
    
    TRANSFER FROM MANHATTAN
    Didi, which merged with then main rival Kuaidi in 2015 to
create a smartphone-based transport services giant, counts as
its core business a mobile app, where users can hail taxis,
privately owned cars, car-pool options and even buses in some
cities. (https://tinyurl.com/y2baugu5)
    Didi had for years aimed for a U.S. IPO because of the
prestige of a New York listing, the presence of comparable peers
like Uber <UBER.N> and Lyft <LYFT.O> and a deeper capital pool,
according to two of the people. 
    Uber and Didi have long-standing links: Uber in 2016 sold
its operation to Didi in exchange for a 17.5% stake in the
Chinese firm, which in turn made a $1 billion investment in
Uber.
    All three people familiar with the matter said Didi has now
opted to consider Hong Kong for the listing amid deteriorating
U.S.-China relations that have left tech firms like TikTok owner
ByteDance in the crosshairs. [nL5N2F030L]
    U.S.-listed Chinese companies now also face tightened
scrutiny and stricter audit requirements there.
    Uninspiring stock performances by Uber and Lyft have also
discouraged Didi from seeking a U.S. IPO, said two of the
people. Uber and Lyft are both trading below their IPO price,
with Lyft shares down more than two-thirds since listing.
    If completed, Didi's IPO would further burnish Hong Kong's
status as a capital markets hub, with $28.8 billion worth of
IPOs and secondary listings carried out in the city between the
start of this year and mid-October, Refinitiv data showed.
    That helped Hong Kong grab the second spot in the global
stock exchange league table - after Nasdaq - despite the city
reeling from a coronavirus pandemic-hit economy and
anti-government protests. 
    Didi's listing plan comes as Ant Group prepares to raise
about $35 billion in a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai in
the coming weeks, in what would be the world's largest IPO.

group Atlantia <ATL.MI> fell more than 4% on Tuesday on concerns
that an offer by state lender CDP and others for its motorway
unit may not be enough to settle a long-running dispute with
Rome. 
    Italy's Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and investment funds
Macquarie and Blackstone late on Monday presented a proposal to
buy Atlantia's 88% stake in motorway unit Autostrade per
l'Italia.[nL8N2HA5H2]
    The proposal did not include any valuation for Autostrade,
two sources close to the matter have told Reuters, a detail that
could jeopardise negotiations between the state lender and
Atlantia.
    ""It is possible that this aspect is creating some
uncertainty and pushes investors to sell,"" a trader said. 
    Several papers said the offer by the CDP-led consortium for
88% of Autostrade could be worth around 9 billion euros ($10.59
billion) before applying a discount to take into account both
risks of future damage claims and possible changes in the
company's economic plan. 
    Atlantia has been embroiled in a legal dispute with Rome
since 2018, when a bridge in Genoa run by Autostrade collapsed
killing 43 people. The government has threatened to strip it of
its motorway licence.
    Atlantia shares were down 2.3% by 0757 GMT, underperforming
Milan's FTSE MIB blue-chip index <.FTMIB>, which was flat.
    Atlantia's board will review the proposal at 0900 GMT on
Tuesday, sources have said. It will also discuss whether to
postpone an Oct. 30 shareholder meeting to vote on an
alternative plan to sell its stake in Autostrade.  
    The CDP-led consortium, which can be broadened to other
Italian investors, aims to sign a memorandum of understanding
with Atlantia by Oct. 28, CDP said in a statement.
    A final offer for Autostrade will be submitted after a
10-week due diligence, the state lender said.
    According to sources, the CDP-led plan envisages CDP having
40% of the consortium, while Macquarie and Blackstone each would
have 30%. CDP could then sell on part of its stake in the
motorway business to Italian investors at a later stage.
    CDP would also appoint the consortium's CEO and chairman,
the people said.

operations.
    Etihad has hired banks including HSBC, Standard Chartered,
Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates NBD
Capital, First Abu Dhabi Bank and Mashreq Bank to arrange
investor calls ahead of the planned five-year deal, the document
showed.

<0293.HK> will cut around 6,000 jobs or 18% of its workforce,
and axe regional brand Cathay Dragon to help it weather the
coronavirus pandemic, the South China Morning Post reported on
Tuesday, citing sources.
    The airline said in June it was reviewing its strategy in
light of the travel downturn, with ""tough decisions"" to be
announced during the fourth quarter and analysts expected it
would announce major job cuts. [nL4N2DM07T]
    In June, the Hong Kong government led a $5 billion rescue
package for the airline, which has been burning through around
HK$1.5 billion to HK$2 billion of cash a month. 
    The South China Morning Post said the airline was expected
to announce the job cuts on Wednesday, adding the figure had
been reduced from 8,000 layoffs after government intervention. 
    The newspaper, citing sources, said the Cathay Dragon brand,
would be sacrificed but staff and resources of the two airlines
would be merged. Cathay did not respond immediately to a request
for comment.
    The airline last month said it would not apply for further
government employment subsidies for its main business units,
freeing up its ability to make major job cuts at Cathay Pacific
and Cathay Dragon, though not at budget carrier HK Express.
[nL4N2G8155]
    Singapore Airlines Ltd <SIAL.SI> has announced plans to cut
around 20% of positions, while Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd
<QAN.AX> has said it will cut nearly 30% of its pre-pandemic
staff, but Cathay had until now refrained from major job cuts.
    The airline has sent around 40% of its passenger fleet to
less humid locations outside Hong Kong for storage.

said on Tuesday it signed a preliminary deal to help transport
oil from the United Arab Emirates to Europe via a pipeline that
connects the Red Sea city of Eilat and the Mediterranean port of
Ashkelon.
    State-owned EAPC said it signed the memorandum of
understanding with MED-RED Land Bridge, a company with Israeli
and Emirati owners, in Abu Dhabi on Monday during a ceremony
with visiting U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.
    The company did not disclose financial details.
    A source familiar with the deal said a final deal could be
worth $700-$800 million over several years and that supplies
could start at the beginning of 2021.

    DUBAI, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Etihad Airways, wholly owned by
the Abu Dhabi government, is planning to sell U.S.
dollar-denominated 'transition' sukuk, or Islamic bonds, a
document issued by one of the banks leading the deal showed.
    Proceeds of so-called transition bonds are used by companies
to gradually switch to more environmentally sustainable
operations.
    Etihad has hired HSBC and Standard Chartered as joint global
coordinators and ""joint sustainability structuring agents"" for
the planned deal.
    Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates NBD
Capital, First Abu Dhabi Bank and Mashreq Bank will also be
involved in the transaction.
    The planned sukuk, which will be issued depending on market
conditions, will have a five-year maturity and are part of a $3
billion sukuk programme expected to be rated 'A' by Fitch.
    A series of fixed income investor calls ahead of the deal
will begin on Oct. 22, the document said. One source familiar
with the deal said the transaction is likely to be at least $1
billion in size. 
    The airline has also invited holders of its outstanding $1.5
billion sukuk due in 2021 to tender those notes for purchase by
Etihad for cash, the document said.
    Etihad did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

    CHICAGO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - When she is not helping her kids
with remote school or worrying about her next mortgage payment,
Jessica Trujillo spends her days rallying friends and co-workers
to lobby Washington for federal aid to protect airline workers
who feel their fates are trapped in a political tug-of-war.
    After so far failing to convince Congress to approve another
$25 billion bailout for coronavirus-slammed airlines, the
industry is looking to a fresh Tuesday deadline set by
Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi for a
COVID-19 relief deal with the Republican White House.
[nL1N2HA1X4]
    Airlines were hoping for legislation before Sept. 30, when a
first package tied to job protections expired despite broad
bipartisan support as Democrats and Republicans wrestled with
conflicting agendas and priorities before the Nov. 3 election.
    ""We're pawns,"" said Houston resident Trujillo, one of at
least 50,000 airline workers - along with her flight attendant
husband Rene - without a paycheck.
    United Airlines <UAL.O> and American Airlines <AAL.O>, two
of the top three U.S. carriers, have furloughed 32,000 workers.
At least 20,000 other employees of the two companies have taken
unpaid leaves of absence while watching rollercoaster
negotiations in Washington that have seen prospects for more aid
rise and fall on a daily, and even hourly, basis.
    ""We are bare-bones right now and the emotions back and forth
are really really hard,"" said Trujillo. She and her husband both
chose unpaid leave from United in order to ensure medical
coverage after losing Rene's brother, who did not have health
insurance, to the coronavirus in September. 
    They are part of a politically diverse group of airline
workers from gate agents to pilots who have spent the past three
months bombarding lawmakers with phone calls, letters, emails,
social media posts and marches pleading for more airline payroll
support either through a large COVID-19 relief deal or a
standalone bill.
    Last week President Donald Trump was willing to raise his
offer of $1.8 trillion for a COVID-19 relief deal with Democrats
in the U.S. Congress, but the idea was shot down by Senate
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a fellow Republican, who plans
a Senate vote on a $500 billion proposal on Wednesday.
    Meanwhile, Pelosi has stuck to her demand for a $2.2
trillion aid and stimulus package. 
    ""I think I can speak for a lot of my colleagues when we say
we’ve lost faith in our elected officials,"" said Miami-based
Phillip Delahunty, one of 19,000 furloughed American Airlines
employees. ""I feel like our livelihoods and our well-being are
being used for political gain in this country right now.""  
    Congressional aides said Monday the chances for a standalone
measure to provide payroll assistance to U.S. airlines before
the Nov. 3 election had dimmed. 
    Rene Trujillo expressed a ""huge level of disconnect"" between
politicians and American workers. ""I honestly feel that we're
just leverage in everybody else's game,"" he said.
    Trump is trailing his Democratic rival Joe Biden nationally
and in battleground states, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling
conducted Oct. 9-13, less than a month before the election.
[nL1N2H51HT]
    United and American have both vowed to bring back employees
if lawmakers extend relief.
    ""It's like we're in purgatory,"" said Jennyne Trani, a single
mom in Las Vegas who was furloughed by United and has held off
on upending her family and moving somewhere more affordable
while she awaits news from Washington.
    ""Just tell us,"" she said. ""I gotta figure my life out.""

 (Adds Cathay comment in paragraph 5, capacity outlook)
    Oct 20 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd
<0293.HK> will cut around 6,000 jobs, or 18% of its workforce,
and axe regional brand Cathay Dragon to help it weather the
coronavirus pandemic, the South China Morning Post reported on
Tuesday, citing sources.
    The airline said in June it was reviewing its strategy in
light of the travel downturn, with ""tough decisions"" to be
announced during the fourth quarter and analysts expected it
would announce major job cuts. [nL4N2DM07T]
    That month the Hong Kong government also led a $5 billion
rescue package for the airline, which has been burning through
around HK$1.5 billion ($193.55 million) to HK$2 billion of cash
a month.
    The South China Morning Post said the airline was expected
to announce the job cuts on Wednesday, adding the figure had
been reduced from 8,000 layoffs after government intervention. 
    The newspaper, citing unidentified sources, said the airline
will sacrifice Cathay Dragon but staff and resources of the two
airlines would be merged. Cathay declined to comment.
    The airline last month said it would not apply for further
government employment subsidies for its main business units,
allowing it to make job cuts at Cathay Pacific and Cathay
Dragon, though not at budget carrier HK Express. [nL4N2G8155]
    Cathay had refrained from major job cuts but Singapore
Airlines Ltd <SIAL.SI> has announced plans to cut around 20% of
positions, while Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd <QAN.AX> has
said it will cut nearly 30% of its pre-pandemic staff.
    Cathay has sent around 40% of its passenger fleet to less
humid locations outside Hong Kong for storage. On Monday, the
airline said it expected to operate less than 50% of its
pre-pandemic passenger flight capacity in 2021. [nL4N2HA1CJ]
    Passenger numbers in September fell 98.1% compared with a
year earlier due to border closures, though cargo carriage was
down by only 36.6%.

Tuesday it was launching legal procedures against Cyprus and
Malta over their investor citizenship programmes, also referred
to as ""golden passport"" schemes.
    The European Union executive said in a statement that the
decision was taken because the two member states granted
nationality – and thereby EU citizenship – in exchange for a
pre-determined payment or investment and without a genuine link
with the country concerned.
    ""The Cypriot and Maltese governments have two months to
reply to the letters of formal notice,"" said the Commission,
adding it could escalate the legal cases if the two countries do
not provide satisfactory answers or make amends.   
    A deputy head at the bloc's executive, Values and
Transparency Commissioner Vera Jourova said: ""There cannot be a
weak link in EU efforts to curb corruption and money laundering.

rain in southeastern France is expected to cost 210 million
euros ($248.12 million) in insurance claims, French insurance
body FFA and reinsurer CCR said on Monday.
    FFA and CCR also said in a statement that 72 percent of the
insurance claims will be paid for damaged houses.
    The southeastern region of Alpes Maritimes was lashed in
early October by torrential rain caused by Storm Alex and
swollen rivers swept away houses, bridges and parts of roads.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The European Union's executive
said on Tuesday it was launching legal action against Cyprus and
Malta over their investor citizenship programmes that are
sometimes referred to as ""golden passport"" schemes.
    The European Commission said in a statement that the
decision was taken because the two member states granted
nationality – and thereby EU citizenship – in exchange for a
pre-determined payment or investment and without a genuine link
with the country concerned.
    ""There cannot be a weak link in EU efforts to curb
corruption and money laundering. EU passports cannot be for
sale,"" Values and Transparency Commissioner Vera Jourova said on
Twitter after the announcement by the European Commission.
    Malta, with a population of 420,000, has sought to attract
foreign capital with schemes such as a cash-for-passport
programme, even though the EU has highlighted the risks of this
potentially attracting the proceeds of criminal activities.
    Under the scheme, people can obtain a Maltese passport by
investing in the country.
    Cyprus said last week it was suspending its citizenship-for-
investment programme, ditching a scheme the government had 
acknowledged was open to abuse. 
    Thousands of rich non-Europeans benefited from the plan
introduced by Cyprus in 2013 offering a passport and visa-free
travel throughout the EU in return for a minimum 2 million euro
investment.
    The European Commission said the Cypriot and Maltese
governments had two months to reply to letters of formal notice
and it could escalate the legal cases if the two countries do
not provide satisfactory answers or make amends.
    Under the EU's infringement procedure, the European
Commission can refer cases to the bloc's Court of Justice and
ultimately it can ask the court to impose penalties.

    By Ari Rabinovitch and Tova Cohen
    JERUSALEM, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Israeli pipeline company EAPC
said on Tuesday it had signed a preliminary deal to help
transport oil from the United Arab Emirates to Europe via a
pipeline that connects the Red Sea city of Eilat and the
Mediterranean port of Ashkelon.
    If finalised, the deal will be one of the most significant
partnerships to emerge so far since Israel and the United Arab
Emirates normalised relations.
    State-owned EAPC said it signed a binding memorandum of
understanding with MED-RED Land Bridge, a company with Israeli
and Emirati owners, in Abu Dhabi on Monday during a ceremony
with visiting U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.
    Along with UAE oil, the partners hope to use their ""land
bridge"", which saves time, fuel and costs versus crossing the
Suez Canal, to transport oil back and forth between other
countries. It could provide quicker access for consumers in Asia
to oil produced in the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions.
    ""MED-RED is in advanced negotiations with major players in
the West and in the East for long-term service agreements,"" EAPC
said.
    It did not disclose financial details, but said the
arrangement ""is likely to increase the transferred quantities by
tens of millions of tons per year.""
    The UAE exports the vast majority of its crude oil to Asia.
    A source familiar with the deal said that, if finalised, it
could be worth $700-$800 million over several years and that
supplies could start at the beginning of 2021.
    EAPC, or Europe Asia Pipeline Co, operates its eponymous
pipeline and deals in oil storage and the export and import of
distillates.
    MED-RED is owned by Petromal, a unit of Abu Dhabi-based
National Holding, Israeli firm AF Entrepreneurship, and Lubber
Line, an international group that focuses on infrastructure and
energy.
    ""There is no doubt that this agreement is of high importance
to the Israeli market, both economically and strategically, with
joint investments extending a decade into the future,"" said EAPC
Chairman Erez Halfon.
    Under the agreement EAPC will manage storing and
transmitting the oil.

airline Wizz Air <WIZZ.L> said on Tuesday it would further
reduce unit costs compared to the rest of the airline industry
thanks to regular deliveries of new Airbus <AIR.PA> aircraft
despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Speaking at an event hosted by the UK Aviation Club, Jozsef
Varadi also bemoaned a lack of political coordination over
measures to tackle the crisis and predicted greater state
involvement in the sector after a series of public bailouts.

for passengers has been launched at London's Heathrow Airport,
designed to return results in an hour, in an effort to re-open
restricted routes and boost traffic for airlines.
    The tests were launched on Tuesday in conjunction with the
airport, IAG's British Airways <ICAG.L>, Virgin Atlantic and
Cathay Pacific, initially for flights to Hong Kong, where
incoming passengers must be able to show proof of a negative
test.
    ""(Testing) is a key part of the solution for getting travel
moving again. There's a lot of support to make sure that we can
get these things up and running, and moving quickly,"" said David
Evans, joint chief executive of medical travel firm Collinson,
which is running the tests with airport services company
Swissport.
    The firms have also set up an inbound testing facility at
Heathrow, though it is yet to be approved for use by the
government. [nL8N2FL2B8]        
    Britain is looking at ways to reduce the 14-day quarantine
period which applies to some arriving passengers, using a mix of
COVID-19 testing and self-isolation. A taskforce looking at the
issue will report back in November. [nL8N2GY598]
    ""I think the government's been too slow to listen to the
evolving medical evidence,"" Evans told Reuters.     
    Collinson use a so-called ""LAMP"" test that can produce
results in around about 60 minutes, much faster than the PCR
tests in use which can take more than a day to be processed in
labs.
    Evans said he expected outbound testing to be rolled out for
Italy and other European destinations in the coming days and
weeks.
    ""As with security screening when it came in... this will be
something that we're going to be living with for the next six to
twelve months, and perhaps beyond,"" he said.

with the EU would be ""extremely damaging"" and cut profits by up
to a quarter at carmaker Bentley, its boss told Reuters, as the
government urges firms to plan for potential disruption. 
    Britain said on Monday there was still no basis for talks
with Brussels to resume, just over two months before free and
unfettered trade is due to end, leading to possible tariffs,
customs checks and long delays for imports and exports. 
    The Volkswagen-owned luxury brand has spent millions to
prepare, including stockpiling, switching ports and a
provisional air freight contract, but warned on failure to find
an agreement.
    ""It would be extremely damaging,"" Chief Executive Adrian
Hallmark told Reuters on Tuesday. 
    ""If you took the duties on components, 45% of the bits we
buy in, and the 10% tariff on cars, worst-case scenario, it
would take out a significant percentage of our profits,"" he
said. ""(It) would probably cost us 20% to 25%.""

<0293.HK> recortará unos 6.000 puestos de trabajo, el 18% de su
plantilla, y se deshará de la aerolínea regional Cathay Dragon
para ayudar al grupo de aviación a capear la pandemia de
coronavirus, reportó el martes el diario South China Morning
Post, citando fuentes.
    El grupo de aerolíneas dijo en junio que estaba revisando su
estrategia a la luz de la caída de los viajes, con la previsión
de anuncios de ""decisiones difíciles"" durante el cuarto
trimestre, ante lo cual los analistas esperaban importantes
recortes de personal.
    En junio, el gobierno de Hong Kong encabezó un paquete de
rescate de 5.000 millones de dólares para Cathay, que ha estado
quemando caja por entre 1.500 millones y 2.000 millones de
dólares al mes.
    El South China Morning Post dijo que se espera que la
aerolínea anuncie los recortes de personal el miércoles,
añadiendo que la cifra se ha reducido desde una primera de 8.000
tras la intervención del gobierno hongkonés. 
    Citando fuentes, el periódico dijo que la marca Cathay
Dragon desaparecerá pero que el personal y los recursos de las
dos aerolíneas se fusionarán. Cathay no respondió inmediatamente
a una solicitud de comentarios.

    By Costas Pitas
    Oct 20 (Reuters) - Failure to strike a Brexit trade deal
with the EU would be ""extremely damaging"" and cut profits by up
to a quarter at carmaker Bentley, its boss told Reuters, as the
government urges firms to plan for potential disruption. 
    Britain said on Monday there was still no basis for talks
with Brussels to resume, just over two months before free and
unfettered trade is due to end, leading to possible tariffs,
customs checks and long delays for imports and exports. 
    The Volkswagen-owned luxury brand has spent millions to
prepare, including stockpiling, switching ports and a
provisional air freight contract, but warned on failure to find
an agreement.
    ""It would be extremely damaging,"" Chief Executive Adrian
Hallmark told Reuters on Tuesday. 
    ""If you took the duties on components, 45% of the bits we
buy in, and the 10% tariff on cars, worst-case scenario, it
would take out a significant percentage of our profits,"" he
said. ""(It) would probably cost us 20% to 25%."" 
    After a 288 million euro (263 million pound) operating loss
in 2018, the firm returned to the black in 2019 with a 65
million euro profit following a turnaround plan with record
sales of 11,006 vehicles. 
    Disruption between Britain, the world's sixth-biggest
economy, and the EU, the largest trading bloc, would come on top
of the hit caused by COVID-19, which prompted Bentley to stop
production between mid-March and early May. 
    Output has neared full capacity since mid-September, as
distancing measures in the factory are enforced, and the firm
has seen a strong bounceback in major markets such as China.
    ""In August, September, October, we've been running at about
20-25% above the pre-crisis planned level of orders ... in
China,"" said Hallmark.
    There have been smaller increases in Europe and the U.S. and
flat levels in Britain, South Asia and the Middle East.  
    ""They didn't close China down,"" he said. ""The coronavirus
didn't suppress economic activity anywhere near as much as we
put the brakes on and the fundamentals have been strong.""

    BRUSSELS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The upcoming revamp of the
European Union's emissions trading system (ETS) should redirect
more revenues to poorer countries needing support to cut
greenhouse gas emissions, according to Poland, the EU's biggest
hard coal producer.
    At meeting of EU environment ministers in Luxembourg on
Friday, Poland will propose changes to the system of allocating
ETS permits and the creation of a new ""energy solidarity fund""
to support low-income countries, according to a Polish
government paper seen by Reuters.
    ""What we need is the EU ETS that drives investments to
regions and sectors located in less wealthy member states with
reduced levels of capital,"" the document said. 
    It also pushed back against an idea, which EU countries have
agreed to explore, of using emissions trading revenues to boost
the bloc's next joint budget. [nL3N2ES28Q]
    The EU ETS puts a price on pollution by forcing power plants
and factories to buy permits to cover emissions. Each country is
allocated permits, which it can sell or hand to some sectors for
free.
    The EU's executive Commission is due to propose a major
overhaul of the ETS next year to help deliver a more ambitious
target to cut emissions by 2030. [nL4N2G83I8]
    That target is still being negotiated by EU countries, which
must all agree. Carbon-intensive states are demanding more
economic analysis on how a tougher target would affect them, and
want guarantees the EU will provide funds to help them.
[nL8N2H64GG]
    Warsaw has said climate goals must not aggravate ""energy
poverty"" among those worst-off.
    Poland, which depends on coal for more than 70% of its
electricity, also said a ""modernisation fund"" for poorer EU
countries, or ETS revenue set aside for green investments,
should be expanded as the COVID-19 pandemic had increased
investment needs in the sector.
    The Luxembourg meeting of the bloc's 27 environment
ministers is due to take place in person on Friday despite much
of the continent restricting public events and daily life as
coronavirus infections surge anew.

    DUBAI, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Etihad Airways, wholly owned by
the Abu Dhabi government, is planning to sell U.S.
dollar-denominated 'transition' sukuk, or Islamic bonds, a
document issued by one of the banks leading the deal showed.
    Proceeds of so-called transition bonds are used by companies
to gradually switch to more environmentally sustainable
operations.
    Etihad's plans include using more fuel-efficient planes and
eliminating single-use plastics, according to an investor
presentation. The airline aims to cut its 2019 carbon emissions
level in half by 2035 and to zero by 2050.
    Etihad has hired HSBC and Standard Chartered as joint global
coordinators and ""joint sustainability structuring agents"" for
the planned deal.
    Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates NBD
Capital, First Abu Dhabi Bank and Mashreq Bank will also be
involved in the transaction.
    The planned sukuk, which will be issued depending on market
conditions, will have a five-year maturity and are part of a $3
billion sukuk programme expected to be rated 'A' by Fitch.
    A series of fixed income investor calls ahead of the deal
will begin on Oct. 22, the document said. One source familiar
with the deal said the transaction is likely to be at least $1
billion in size. 
    The airline has also invited holders of its outstanding $1.5
billion sukuk due in 2021 to tender those notes for purchase by
Etihad for cash, the document said.
    Etihad did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

    LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The world will have a smaller
airline industry as a result of the coronavirus crisis with many
privately funded carriers set to go under and governments
throwing ""good money after bad"" to keep national champions
afloat, Wizz Air's CEO <WIZZ.L> said.
    Worst hit will be traditional carriers relying on a
hub-and-spoke network and business traffic, but Wizz expects
demand for its own cheap fares and direct routes to snap back
quickly once the pandemic fades, the Hungarian airline's founder
said.
    Wizz aims to widen a gap in unit costs compared to the rest
of the airline industry thanks to regular deliveries of new
Airbus <AIR.PA> aircraft, Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi added.
    Speaking in a webinar hosted by the UK-based Aviation Club,
he bemoaned a lack of political coordination over travel
restrictions and other measures to tackle the crisis and urged
policymakers to pay more attention to the economic impact.

Heathrow introdujo pruebas de COVID-19 rápidas para pasajeros,
diseñadas para tener resultados en una hora, en un esfuerzo por
reabrir rutas restringidas y aumentar el tráfico de las
aerolíneas.
    Las pruebas se iniciaron el martes en conjunto con British
Airways <ICAG.L>, Virgin Atlantic y Cathay Pacific, inicialmente
para vuelos a Hong Kong, donde los pasajeros deben mostrar una
prueba negativa para ingresar al territorio.
    Reino Unido está buscando formas de reducir el período de
cuarentena de 14 días que se aplica a algunos pasajeros que
llegan al país, utilizando una combinación de pruebas de
COVID-19 y autoaislamiento.

primeiras medidas de isolamento social no país para tentar
conter a pandemia da Covid-19.
    No período de 16 de março a 11 de outubro, a companhia
registrou declínio de 10,8%. [nL1N2H4253]
    Na rodovia dos Imigrantes, um dos principais ativos da
empresa, a redução no tráfego passou de 11,8% para 11,6% na
mesma base de comparação.

forecast)
    Oct 20 (Reuters) - Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd <CP.TO>
missed Street estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the
railroad operator was hurt by lower freight volumes during the
COVID-19 pandemic. 
    The company's operating ratio, a measure of operating
expenses as a percentage of revenue and a key metric for Wall
Street, rose to 58.2% from 56.1% a year earlier. A lower
operating ratio signals improved profitability. 
    Canadian Pacific, however, said it expects at least
mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth in 2020. 
    The pandemic compounded woes for rail operators, which moved
record amounts of Canadian oil at the start of this year but
witnessed a plunge in crude volumes later due to production cuts
by energy companies.  [nL2N2ET23D]
    Canadian Pacific's energy, chemicals and plastic shipments
dropped 30% during the third quarter.
    Its total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars
during a specified period, fell 7%.
    Net income fell 3.2% to C$598 million ($453.48 million), or
C$4.41 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30. Revenue
declined by about 6% to C$1.86 billion. [nPnf8sz2a]
    On an adjusted basis, Canadian Pacific earned C$4.12 per
share, missing an average Street estimate of C$4.23, according
to Refinitiv data.

leaders in the northern region of Greater Manchester have failed
to reach agreement on imposing stricter restrictions to control
the spread of COVID-19, housing minister Robert Jenrick said on
Tuesday.
    The mayor of Greater Manchester had called for more
financial support for the region's businesses which would be
forced to shut under the government's tier-3 restrictions, but
the two sides failed to reach agreement.
    The government can introduce the measures without his
support. 
    ""I’m disappointed that despite recognising the gravity of
the situation, the mayor has been unwilling to take the action
that is required to get the spread of the virus under control in
Greater Manchester and reach an agreement with the government. I
have therefore advised the prime minister that these discussions
have concluded without an agreement,"" Jenrick said in a
statement.

which is operating less than a quarter of last year's flights
due to the coronavirus pandemic, reported a third-quarter
operating loss of 1.26 billion euros  ($1.49 billion).
    The German carrier said on Tuesday the loss narrowed from
the second quarter because it was able to resume some flights
and slash costs.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong-20 October 2020:
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Guangxi Communications Investment Group Co., Ltd.'s
(GCI) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and
senior unsecured note rating at 'BBB'. The Outlook on the IDRs is Stable.

GCI's ratings are credit-linked with the credit profile of the company's
sponsor, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), in southern China. We
assess GCI under our Government-Related Entities (GRE) Rating Criteria,
reflecting the company's status, ownership and control; government support
record and expectations; and the socio-political and financial implications of
a CGI default.
Key Rating Drivers
'Very Strong' Status, Ownership and Control: Fitch's assessment of this rating
factor is based on the high level of state control and full state ownership,
despite GCI's legal status under commercial law. GCI is a wholly state-owned
limited liability company under the direct supervision of the Guangxi
State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (Guangxi SASAC),
which exercises full control over the company's operational, financial and
investment activities.

'Very Strong' Support Record and Expectations: GCI relies heavily on local
government support, both financially and operationally. It has received
capital injections, including assets from the Guangxi SASAC and
vehicle-purchase tax rebates from central government via the region's
Department of Finance.

Net capital injections totalled CNY5.3 billion in 2019 or 4% of net assets.
Annual subsidies in 2019 totalled CNY1 billion, which were higher than
historical levels. GCI received CNY17 billion of government support in 8M20,
including special-purpose bonds, subsidies, and a special subsidy to combat
the effects of the coronavirus lockdown in early 2020.

'Moderate' Socio-Political Implications of Default: GCI is the main GRE
responsible for construction and development of Guangxi's highway network. Its
railway investment subsidiary, GRI, is the only local GRE providing timely
funding for development of Guangxi's railway network. GCI's policy role is
crucial in enhancing road and rail between rural areas and major cities in the
region, and vital for cross-border business with south-east Asian nations. We
believe transportation in the region will be disrupted if GCI is unable to
carry out its functions.

'Very Strong' Financial Implications of Default: GCI is one of the largest
GREs under Guangxi SASAC by assets and debt size. GCI is the only GRE
specialising in developing land transportation in Guangxi. A GCI default would
cause widespread damage to the government's and GCI's reputation among
investors, onshore commercial banks and state banks. This could shrink the
funding channels and raise refinancing costs for Guangxi government bonds and
regional GREs.

Weak Standalone Credit Profile: Fitch assesses GCI's Standalone Credit Profile
as 'b', based on a 'Midrange' revenue defensibility and a 'Midrange' operating
risk assessment, and accompanied by a 'Weaker' financial profile.

Revenue Defensibility 'Midrange': We assess GCI's ability to maintain the
revenue profile as 'Midrange', despite operating environment challenges. This
is based on our assessment that the regional economic outlook will benefit
from a fast recovery of the national economy, driving the consumption of fuel
and construction materials.

The toll-road sector's moderate level of demand reflects the potential volume
growth when new roads open, which could make up for the shortfall in an
economic slowdown. On the other hand, GCI's limited pricing power increases
the unpredictability of GCI's toll revenue because the current toll-fee
framework does not provide for the recovery of expenditure via adjustments in
rates.

Operating Risk 'Midrange': GCI's major business sectors have well-identified
cost drivers although limited flexibility on the timing for major costs, such
as near-term capex. Operating costs are also assessed as 'Midrange' because
adjusting charges cannot fully recover increases. Contractors carry out major
works, enabling GCI to fully pass-through supply prices to contractors.
Adequate resources and labour, with limited volatility in the short to medium
term, also contributed to this assessment.

'Weaker' Financial Profile: GCI's net debt was around 20x-30x EBITDA in
2015-2019, with EBITDA interest coverage below 1x. Fitch expects net
debt/EBITDA will normalise in the 2020-2024 forecast period to be around
21x-25x and EBITDA coverage at around 0.9x.
Derivation Summary
GCI's ratings are assessed under Fitch's Government-Related Entities Rating
Criteria, reflecting Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's full ownership and
strong control of GCI as well as the solid support it provides to the company.
Fitch also factors in the socio-political and financial implications for the
government if GCI were to default.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating
action/upgrade:

- An upward revision of Fitch's perception of Guangxi's ability to provide
subsidies, grants or other legitimate resources allowed under China's policies
and regulations would lead to a change in ratings.

Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating
action/downgrade:

- A downward revision of Fitch's perception of Guangxi's ability to provide
subsidies, grants or other legitimate resources allowed under China's policies
and regulations would lead to a change in ratings;

- A downgrade may also result from a significant weakening of our assessment
of the socio-political or financial implications of a default by GCI, the
regional support record or expectations, or a dilution of the government's
shareholding and control.
Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario
International scale credit ratings of Sovereigns, Public Finance and
Infrastructure issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as
the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction)
of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating
downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions,
measured in a negative direction) of three notches over three years. The
complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating
categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit
ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the
methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario
credit ratings, visit [https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].

Applicable Criteria.
ESG Considerations
Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit
relevance is a score of '3'. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have
only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the
way in which they are being managed by the entity. For more information on

and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast

conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by
it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable
verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such
sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The
manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party
verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated
security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in
which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the
availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the
management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing
third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures
letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions
and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent
and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular
security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of
other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that
neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can
ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating
or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its
advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to
Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing
its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including
independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with
respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial
and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions
and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as
facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and
forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not
anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.
The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation
or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the
report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient
of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a
security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established
criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating.
Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no
individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a
report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than
credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged
in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared
authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are
not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are
named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither
a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and
presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the
sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for
any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment
advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any
security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the
suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt
nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch
receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and
underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to
US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain
cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular
issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a
single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to
US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment,
publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a
consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any

    LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The world will have a smaller
airline industry as a result of the coronavirus crisis with many
privately funded carriers set to go under and governments
throwing ""good money after bad"" to keep national champions
afloat, Wizz Air's CEO <WIZZ.L> said.
    Worst hit will be traditional carriers relying on a
hub-and-spoke network and business traffic, but Wizz expects
demand for its own cheap fares and direct routes to snap back
quickly once the pandemic fades, the Hungarian airline's
co-founder said.
    Wizz aims to widen a gap in unit costs compared to the rest
of the airline industry thanks to regular deliveries of new
Airbus <AIR.PA> aircraft, Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi added.
    Co-founded in 2003 by Varadi, a former head of Hungary's
defunct national carrier Malev, Wizz Air is one of Europe's
largest budget carriers with a focus primarily on central and
eastern parts of the continent.
    Speaking in a webinar hosted by the UK-based Aviation Club,
he bemoaned a lack of political coordination over travel
restrictions and other measures to tackle the crisis and urged
policymakers to pay more attention to the economic impact.
    Dozens of countries worldwide, including France and Germany,
have given various forms of public support or taken increased
government stakes in their flag carriers to help them survive
the crisis, which has sharply reduced travel demand.
    But the industry has also faced a tangle of inconsistent
travel and quarantine rules which airlines partially blame for
putting people off taking the reduced number of flights.
    ""As far as Wizz is concerned, the moment COVID falls away I
think we will be back to 2019 levels,"" Varadi said.
    ""We can go very quickly, but the issue is not underlying
consumer demand; the issue is restrictions imposed by
governments.""
    Wizz is operating on half normal traffic now, he said.
    While aircraft deliveries are down sharply as airlines
struggle to preserve cash, Wizz Air has continued to add to its
Airbus fleet during the crisis. Together with India's IndiGo
<INGL.NS> it makes up about a quarter of Airbus deliveries.
    Finance remains available for the small number of airlines
like Wizz that have investment-grade status, Varadi said.
    He also said Wizz was open to other foreign ventures after
forming a startup in Abu Dhabi and expanding in the UK, where it
would continue to invest after Brexit.
    Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, a joint venture between the Hungarian
budget airline and Abu Dhabi state holding company ADQ, has
received an air operator certificate, though its launch has been
hampered by a coronavirus ban on foreign visitors. [nL8N2H80C8]

avançavam mais de 2% nesta terça-feira após notícia de que
acionistas da empresa iniciaram processo arbitral contra a Gol
<GOLL4.SA> por operações de adiantamento de recursos durante a
pandemia de Covid-19.
    A Gol vendeu passagens para a sua controlada Smiles de forma
antecipada, como uma forma de levantar recursos para enfrentar a
crise causada pelo novo coronavírus.
    De acordo com reportagem do Valor Econômico,  os acionistas
da Smiles levaram para a arbitragem um pedido de anulação dessas
operações, com a devolução dos valores envolvidos, cerca de 1,6
bilhão de reais, para o caixa da empresa de milhagens.
    Procurada pela Reuters, Gol e Smiles não quiseram comentar a
notícia. 
    A Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM) pediu
esclarecimentos para as duas companhias.
    Por volta de 10:45, as ações da Smiles subiam 2,4%, a 17,31
reais, enquanto os papéis da Gol tinham variação positiva de 1%,
a 20,11 reais.
    Os fundos multimercado Samba Theta e Centauro I, que
concentram 4,6% da Smiles e foram os responsáveis pelo início da
arbitragem, classificaram a operação como abuso de poder,
segundo a reportagem.

AISCAT said on Tuesday the reported plans put forward to resolve
the dispute over the tollroad concession of Atlantia's <ATL.MI>
unit Autostrade per l'Italia were ""messy"" and not in the public
interest.
    AISCAT said it was not acceptable that the government was
able to influence the choice of investors to buy Autostrade.
    Italy state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and investment
funds Macquarie and Blackstone late on Monday presented a
proposal to buy Atlantia's 88% stake in motorway unit Autostrade
per l'Italia. [nL8N2HA5H2]

    LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Britain's government and local
leaders in the northern region of Greater Manchester have failed
to reach agreement on imposing stricter restrictions to control
the spread of COVID-19, housing minister Robert Jenrick said on
Tuesday.
    Britain is undergoing a second wave of the virus, recording
21,331 new cases and 241 deaths on Tuesday, but Prime Minister
Boris Johnson is resisting pressure for a second national
lockdown and is instead pursuing a strategy of imposing tighter
restrictions in virus hotspots.
    The plan has provoked resistance from leaders in the north
of England, where the worst of the latest outbreaks are
concentrated. 
    The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, had called
for more financial support for the region's businesses which
would be forced to shut under the government's highest tier of
restrictions, but the two sides failed to reach agreement.
    The government is now expected to unilaterally impose
so-called tier 3 restrictions - which include the forced closure
of pubs which do not serve food and an advisory not to travel in
or out of affected regions. 
    ""I'm disappointed that despite recognising the gravity of
the situation, the mayor has been unwilling to take the action
that is required to get the spread of the virus under control in
Greater Manchester and reach an agreement with the government,""
Jenrick said in a statement.
    Burnham told a news conference in Manchester that the
government had failed to meet the minimum amount needed by the
region to protects its poorest, and that it was ministers who
had walked away from talks.
    ""At no point today, where we offered enough to protect the
poorest people in our communities through the punishing reality
of the winter, to come,"" Burnham said.
    ""It cannot be right to close people's place of work, to shut
somebody's business, without giving them proper support so that
they can look after themselves.""

Tokyo's Narita Airport have submitted bids to advise Poland on
the construction of a major new airport in central Poland, a
pillar of the ruling nationalists' flagship infrastructure
investment programme.
    The airport, to be completed around 2030 at an estimated
cost of 31-35 billion zloty ($8-9 bln), would be located between
Warsaw and the city of Lodz.
    Critics such as Ryanair <RYA.I> CEO Michael O'Leary have
said the new airport may be inefficient and its construction
would be a waste of money, but Polish authorities say the
country needs the airport to become a regional transit hub.
    State news agency PAP, quoting the government's top
representative Marcin Horala who is in charge of the airport's
construction, said a strategic adviser would be chosen this
year.
    The adviser may later become a strategic partner for the
Polish airport which is to serve 40-45 million passengers a
year.

 (Adds outlook, cash flow)
    By Ludwig Burger
    FRANKFURT, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Deutsche Lufthansa <LHAG.DE>
reported a third-quarter operating loss of 1.26 billion euros
($1.49 billion) and warned of weak demand during the remainder
of the year.
    The German carrier said on Tuesday that the loss, which
compares with a quarterly profit of 1.3 billion a year earlier,
narrowed from the second quarter because it was able to resume
some flights and slash costs.  
    ""Demand for air travel is expected to remain low in the
coming winter months due to the global evolution of the pandemic
and the associated travel restrictions,"" it said, adding it
would ""withstand further burdens from the corona pandemic"". 
    As a result, Lufthansa group's airlines, based in Germany,
Switzerland, Austria and Belgium, will likely only offer up to
25% of the last year's capacity in the fourth quarter.
    Adjusted free cash flow during the three months through
September fell to a negative 2.07 billion euros from a positive
416 million last year, driven by the reimbursement of 2 billion
euros for pandemic-related flight cancellations.     
    The airlines group said it still has cash reserves of 10.1
billion euros, including 6.3 billion in undrawn state funds from
a bailout granted earlier this year by a number of European
governments.

    By Andy Bruce and William James
    LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris
Johnson said on Tuesday he would impose tougher lockdown
restrictions on the Greater Manchester region in northern
England despite failing to reach a deal on funding support with
local leaders.
    Britain - the worst-hit European nation during the COVID-19
pandemic with nearly 44,000 related deaths - is now seeing a
second wave of the virus, recording 21,331 new cases and 241
deaths on Tuesday. 
    Johnson is resisting pressure for a second national
lockdown, fearful of the disastrous economic effects, and
instead pursuing a localised strategy of imposing three tiers of
increasingly stringent restrictions in virus hotspots in
England. [nL8N2H750M]
    The plan has been resisted by leaders in the north, where
the worst of the latest outbreaks are concentrated, who say the
government isn't providing them with enough financial support to
cope with the tightest restrictions.
    Johnson unilaterally imposed top tier restrictions - which
include the forced closure of pubs which do not serve food and
an advisory not to travel in or out of the region - after talks
with local leaders about a voluntary move into the tier failed.
    ""This evening, informed by the data we have just seen, I can
announce that Greater Manchester will move to the Very High
alert level,"" Johnson told a news conference.
    He said the restrictions would start on Friday and that he
regretted the failure of the talks: ""we would have a better
chance of defeating the virus if we work together.""
    Earlier, Manchester's Labour mayor Andy Burnham told a news
conference that the government had failed to meet the minimum
amount needed by the region to protect its poorest, and that it
was ministers who had walked away from talks.
    ""At no point today, were we offered enough to protect the
poorest people in our communities through the punishing reality
of the winter to come,"" Burnham said.

Pelosi on Tuesday said she was optimistic Democrats could reach
a deal with the Trump administration on additional COVID-19
relief that could get aid out by early next month.
    Pelosi, in an interview with Bloomberg TV, said the
administration had come a long way on health provisions
regarding testing to tackle the outbreak, but that more work was
needed to address state and local aid and liability protections,
among other areas. 
    She added that there should be an indication of a possible
agreement later on Tuesday.

coronavirus pandemic and is working on possible aid, Finance
Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday.
    Freeland told a news conference she had spoken to the heads
of Canada's major airlines last week but did not give details.
Carriers and travel industry executives have repeatedly urged
Ottawa for assistance as passenger numbers slump.

<SGEF.PA> expects earnings to continue falling in the second
half of the year, as weakness at its pandemic-ravaged airports
business outweighs signs of a recovery in construction and
motorway traffic.
    The owner of London's Gatwick airport said on Tuesday the
earnings decline should be less steep than in the first six
months of 2020, when revenue fell 15% and operating income was
down nearly 90%. It expects to return to growth in 2021.  
    Vinci said revenue fell 6.4% to 12.3 billion euros ($14.5
billion) in the third quarter. It managed to contain some of the
fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic after construction projects
restarted, and its contracting unit, which operates in areas
like energy, picked up steam too. 
    But its airports business - hit hard by measures to control
the pandemic, despite an easing of restrictions in recent months
- remained under pressure, including as governments take new
steps to contain the virus' spread. 
    Vinci said it now expected the fall in passenger numbers to
reach 70% this year, compared to its previous forecast for a 65%
fall. 
    CEO Xavier Huillard told a conference call that the group,
which made a 5.2 billion euro bid earlier this month for Cobra,
an industrial unit held by Spanish engineering and
infrastructure group ACS's <ACS.MC>, was now at the due
diligence phase of the deal.

    MADRID, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The Spanish government is
considering new restrictions, including possible curfews, in
hard-hit regions like Madrid to tackle a new wave of coronavirus
contagion, Health Minister Salvador Illa said on Tuesday.
    The country, which has Western Europe's highest case load, 
is likely to surpass one million infections this week and
several regions have toughened their coronavirus restrictions in
the past few days. [nL8N2HA5HZ] 
    ""We have very tough weeks ahead, winter is coming,"" Illa
told reporters. ""The second wave is no longer a threat, it is a
reality in all of Europe.""
    Spain added 13,873 cases on Tuesday, bringing the cumulative
total to 988,322. The death toll jumped by 218 to 34,210,
including 40 deaths in the past 24 hours alone.
    Imposing a curfew in Madrid - one of Europe's hotspots of
the pandemic - and possibly beyond would require invoking a
state of emergency, Illa said. Any such measure lasting more
than two weeks would require the support of some opposition
parties, he added.
    But that could prove challenging in Spain's deeply polarised
parliament. 
    Towards the end of Spain's first state of emergency
lockdowns from March to June, the opposition opposed any further
extensions and has recently been against extending a
government-ordered partial lockdown in Madrid. 
    The Madrid region's top health official, Enrique Ruiz
Escudero, told Spanish news agency Europa Press earlier
authorities were evaluating whether a curfew was needed but they
did not have the power to enforce it and would have to ask the
central government. 
    ""A curfew would mean ... that at some hours there's no
mobility, like France has done for example,"" he said. 
    France last week ordered a curfew in Paris and eight other
cities from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.
    The Socialist-led coalition government declared a two-week
state of emergency on Oct.9 to impose a partial lockdown in and
around Madrid, meaning people can leave their homes but must
remain within the city.
    Following weeks of disagreement between regional and
national authorities over what policies to adopt, minister Illa
said the government would not seek an extension of its decree
after it expires on Friday.
    However, he said yet unspecified tough restrictions would
have to be imposed in Madrid for three weeks in any case.

los demócratas puedan llegar a un acuerdo con el gobierno de
Donald Trump sobre la ayuda económica adicional por el COVID-19,
que podría estar a principios del mes que viene.
    Pelosi, en una entrevista con Bloomberg TV, dijo que el

    La líder demócrata añadió que debería haber una señal de un
posible acuerdo más tarde el martes.

    MILAN/ROME, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Atlantia <ATL.MI> is expected
to give a consortium led by state lender CDP another five to six
days to finalise a binding bid for its 88% stake in motorway
business Autostrade per l'Italia, three sources said on Tuesday.
    Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and investment funds Macquarie and
Blackstone presented a proposal late on Monday to buy Atlantia's
stake in Autostrade. [nL8N2HA5H2]
    The proposal said the consortium aimed to sign a memo of
understanding with Atlantia by Oct. 28 with a binding offer to
follow after 10-weeks of due diligence.
    But a board meeting of Atlantia on Tuesday decided to give
CDP extra time to come up with a binding offer with a price that
could be subject to adjustments after the due diligence, two
sources said.
    Atlantia declined to comment.
    Atlantia has been embroiled in a legal dispute with Rome
since 2018, when a bridge run by Autostrade collapsed killing 43
people. The government has threatened to strip it of its
motorway licence.
    Last week, CDP and Atlantia began exclusive talks to try to
rescue a deal that had foundered over a series of issues
including valuation and legal liabilities.
    Atlantia, which besides running motorways in Italy and
abroad also operates airports, needs to secure an offer it deems
attractive in the short-term or it will have to fall back on
previous plans for a spin-off of its Autostrade stake.
    The group has a shareholder meeting scheduled for Oct. 30
and will press ahead with a vote to spin off Autostrade and sell
it to institutional investors unless CDP delivers an attractive
offer in time, sources have said.
    CDP is asking Atlantia to postpone the meeting to give more
time for negotiations.    
    One source said the offer by the CDP-led consortium could
value Autostrade at up to 9.5 billion euros before applying a
discount for the risks of future damage claims for the bridge
collapse and possible changes in the company's economic and
financial plan.

    By Tracy Rucinski
    CHICAGO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - When she is not helping her kids
with remote school or worrying about her next mortgage payment,
Jessica Trujillo spends her days rallying friends and co-workers
to lobby Washington for federal aid to protect airline workers
who feel their fates are trapped in a political tug-of-war.
    The industry has so far failed to secure another $25 billion
bailout for coronavirus-slammed airlines; however, U.S. House of
Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday she was
optimistic Democrats could reach a deal with the Republican
Trump administration on additional COVID-19 relief that could
get aid out by early next month. [nW1N2G5009]
    Airlines had pushed for broad COVID-19 legislation or a
standalone bill before Sept. 30, when a first package tied to
job protections expired despite wide bipartisan support as
Democrats and Republicans wrestled with conflicting agendas and
priorities before the Nov. 3 election.
    ""We're pawns,"" said Houston resident Trujillo, one of at
least 50,000 airline workers - along with her flight attendant
husband Rene - without a paycheck. Both are members of the
Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which is among the airline
unions that has helped organize lobbying efforts.
    United Airlines <UAL.O> and American Airlines <AAL.O>, two
of the top three U.S. carriers, have furloughed 32,000 workers.
At least 20,000 other employees of the two companies have taken
unpaid leaves of absence while watching rollercoaster
negotiations in Washington that have seen prospects for more aid
rise and fall on a daily, and even hourly, basis.
    ""We are bare-bones right now and the emotions back and forth
are really really hard,"" said Trujillo. She and her husband both
chose unpaid leave from United in order to ensure medical
coverage after Rene's brother, who did not have health
insurance, died from coronavirus in September. 
    Employees from gate agents to pilots have spent the past
three months bombarding lawmakers with phone calls, letters,
emails, social media posts and marches pleading for more airline
payroll support either through a large COVID-19 relief deal or a
standalone bill.
    President Donald Trump on Tuesday pushed for a comprehensive
COVID-19 relief package, saying he would accept a deal worth
more than the $2.2 trillion floated by Pelosi despite opposition
to large spending measures among his fellow Republicans in the
U.S. Senate. [nL1N2HB0H1]
    ""I think I can speak for a lot of my colleagues when we say
we’ve lost faith in our elected officials,"" said Miami-based
Phillip Delahunty, one of 19,000 furloughed American Airlines
employees. ""I feel like our livelihoods and our well-being are
being used for political gain in this country right now.""  
    Congressional aides said Monday the chances for a standalone
measure to provide payroll assistance to U.S. airlines before
the Nov. 3 election had dimmed. 
    United and American have both vowed to bring back employees
if lawmakers extend relief.
    ""It's like we're in purgatory,"" said Jennyne Trani, a single
mom in Las Vegas who was furloughed by United and has held off
on moving her family somewhere more affordable while she awaits
news from Washington.
    ""Just tell us,"" she said. ""I gotta figure my life out.""

    OTTAWA, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The Canadian government is very
aware of the challenges facing airlines and the travel sector
during the coronavirus pandemic and is working on possible aid,
Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday.
    Freeland said she had spoken to the heads of Canada's major
airlines and unions last week but did not give details. Carriers
and travel industry executives have repeatedly urged Ottawa for
assistance as passenger numbers slump.
    ""We are obviously aware of the particular challenges that
the travel sector, the airlines are facing right now,"" she told
a news conference when asked about an aid package.
    ""It's definitely an issue we are looking at closely and
working on,"" she said.
    Airlines have already received more than C$1 billion ($763
million) from a wage subsidy program that Ottawa introduced to
help businesses deal with the pandemic, she said.
    Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc told CTV
on Sunday that Ottawa might take a stake in major airlines such
as Air Canada <AC.TO> and WestJet Airlines. Both carriers have
suspended dozens of routes.
    The Canadian branch of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers on Tuesday urged Freeland to
consider partially or fully nationalizing Air Canada.  
    Earlier this month major labor unions said the aviation
sector would suffer permanent damage unless Ottawa provided a
C$7 billion 10-year low-interest loan to offset the effects of
the pandemic. [nL1N2GS1D7]

Ouattara will launch a 62 trillion CFA francs ($112 billion)
investment plan over five years in the West African nation if
re-elected on Oct. 31, a senior aide told business leaders on
Tuesday.
    The plan, from 2021 to 2025, would focus on improving
infrastructure in the world's top cocoa grower, said Patrick
Achi, secretary general of Ivory Coast's presidency and
Ouattara's campaign manager. It would also aim to remove
red-tape, fight corruption and boost private sector investment.
    Ouattara, who has presided over a period of steady growth
averaging around 8% annually between 2011 and 2020 - one of
world's fastest as the country emerged from civil wars in 2002
and 2010-2011 - is seeking a third term that his opponents say
violates the constitution.
    Violence has erupted in the country with more than a dozen
killed since August, while two opposition candidates have called
for a boycott. [nL4N2HA38O]
    The election in the regional economic powerhouse comes at a
delicate moment for West Africa.
    In neighbouring Guinea, voters went to the polls on Sunday
for a presidential election in which octogenarian President
Alpha Conde is also seeking a third term after forcing a
constitutional referendum that allowed him to run, despite
violent opposition protests. [nL8N2HA5BY] 
    Achi told business leaders in Abidjan that the framework of
Ouattara's investment plan had been discussed with the
International Monetary Fund.
    He said the government would tap regional and international
debt markets to finance the plan, but did not give details.
    Business leaders in the country are, however, worried about
the ongoing violence, fearing it could potentially escalate
after the election.
    ""It is possible to achieve the ambitious plan, it but it
will take stability as between 2011 and 2020, otherwise it will
not be possible,"" said a chief executive of a construction
company, who participated in the meeting.

    COMPANIES
      
    (*) ATLANTIA <ATL.MI>
    State lender CDP is working on a 8.8-9 billion binding offer
for 88% stake in Atlantia's tollway operator, but about 1
billion could be deducted for provisions for legal risks related
to the collapse of the Morandi bridge in 2018, Corriere said.
     The offer would come from a vehicle controlled 51% by Cdp
and 49% by Blackstone and Macquarie funds. The CDP stake would
be controlled by a second vehicle 49% owned by a group of
Italian investors such as pension funds and financial
institutions such as Poste Vita, the newspaper added.
    Disagreements on governance have emerged between CDP and the
two funds, Blackstone and Macquarie, Il Messaggero said.
According to several newspapers, the state lender will not put
forward a binding offer for the motorway operator in time for
Monday deadline set by Atlantia and is leaning towards
presenting a simple expression of interest.
    Il Sole 24 Ore does not exclude an interest in Atlantia unit
from other big names in the insurance sector, such as Generali
<GASI.MI> or UnipolSai <US.MI>, while among foreigners investors
it mentions seven other possible candidates besides Blackstone
and Macquarie, without stating their names.
    
    BANCO BPM <BAMI.MI>
    Italy's third-largest bank Banco BPM has agreed to share
confidential information with the local arm of Credit Agricole
to explore a potential tie-up, a source familiar with the matter
said on Thursday. [nL8N2H614O]
    
    MONTE DEI PASCHI DI SIENA <BMPS.MI>
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is expected  in the
next few days to sign long-awaited measures paving the way for a
crucial bad loan clean-up at Monte dei Paschi and the sale of
the bank, two government sources said. [nL8N2H669D]
    The appointment of former Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan
as chairman-designate of UniCredit would make it inappropriate
for the Italian bank to buy state-owned Monte Paschi, lawmakers
from Italy's co-ruling 5-Star Movement said. [nL8N2H65EH]
    (*) A Milan court convicted three former executives of Banca
Monte dei Paschi at the end of a long-running false accounting
case on Thursday, a result that could hinder Italy's bid to
re-privatise the world's oldest bank. Former chairman Alessandro
Profumo, former CEO Fabrizio Viola and former president of the
statutory auditors' board Paolo Salvadori were accused of not
correctly booking two derivative transactions - known as
Alexandria and Santorini - between 2012 and 2015. [nL8N2H65JZ]
   (*)  The ruling could increase the amount of claims Monte dei
Paschi faces from investors who lost their savings, La Stampa
said.

    LEONARDO <LDOF.MI>
    Leonardo said ""conditions do not exist"" for Alessandro
Profumo to step down as CEO after a court of first instance set
a jail sentence in a case regarding his previous role as
chairman of Monte dei Paschi di Siena. The ruling is subject to
appeal. [nL8N2H66GP]

the current management and the list presented by the outgoing
board ahead the shareholders' meeting for the renewal of the

    By Tim Hepher
    LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Robert
Lighthizer said on Tuesday he was ""very pleased"" with progress
in negotiations with Britain over a trade agreement and
predicted a deal ""reasonably soon"".
    The United States and Britain launched negotiations on a
free-trade agreement in May, vowing to work quickly to seal a
deal as Britain completes its exit from the European Union.
    Lighthizer, speaking by video link from Washington to a
British government conference on transatlantic co-operation,
said talks were taking place continuously despite being split
into rounds, while hinting at some negotiating differences.
    ""These things take time ... but we are making great headway
and we have got 30-some groups negotiating and negotiating
bitterly right now,"" Lighthizer told the Atlantic Future Forum.
    ""I am optimistic across the board and I think that it is
going to happen reasonably soon,"" he said of a possible deal.
    British trade minister Liz Truss, speaking by remote link to
the same conference, said western port cities like Liverpool
would benefit from a U.S. trade deal as Britain widens its gaze
beyond a 45-year-old bias in favour of trade ties with the EU.
    The tone of the public exchange contrasted with a stand-off
between London and Brussels over Britain's future trade ties
with the EU following its exit from the bloc in January.
    The EU and Britain urged each other on Tuesday to compromise
to avoid a disruptive Brexit finale. [nL8N2HB24U]
    Lighthizer, who has named the UK trade talks one of his top
priorities for 2020, has called for full access for U.S.
agricultural products. [nL1N20O07]    
    The two sides are seen at odds, however, over tariffs
including U.S. steel and aluminium duties imposed in 2018.
    
    TARIFFS 'NOT THE ANSWER'
    A growing potential flashpoint concerns Britain's close
links to jetmaker Airbus <AIR.PA>, which is at the centre of a
16-year-old transatlantic trade spat over aircraft subsidies.
    The EU has won the right to hit back with tariffs on U.S.
goods to punish U.S. subsidies to Boeing <BA.N> - a year after
Washington slapped duties on EU goods over subsidies granted to
Airbus by Britain, France, Germany and Spain. [nL8N2H44BN]
    U.S. President Donald Trump has said Washington will ""strike
back harder"" at any European tariffs.
    Analysts say Britain is squeezed between applying its share
of the tariffs in defence of Airbus and risking a setback in 
trade talks with the United States, or delaying them and further
corroding tense talks over a European trade deal.[nL8N2H33EL] 
    Without referring to recent tariff wars between the United
States and China, Truss questioned the use of tariffs but did
not address how Britain would handle the Boeing subsidies case.
    ""Even before the COVID crisis started we have seen trade
barriers going up and we have seen tariffs being raised, and
that surely is not the answer,"" Truss said.
    Lighthizer defended the right of nations to defend their
trade interests but said this did not amount to protectionism.
    ""Nationalisam is not necessarily a bad thing. ... Countries
becoming stronger is not necessarily inconsistent with
international trade,"" he told the conference.
    Both officials called for an overhaul of the Geneva-based
World Trade Organization as it prepares to select a new leader. 
    ""There is no doubt that there needs to be reform at the WTO.
We need to make the global trading system work,"" Truss said.

Atlantia's EGM)
    By Stephen Jewkes and Francesca Landini
    MILAN/ROME, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Italy's Atlantia <ATL.MI>
said it would give a consortium led by state lender Cassa
Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) until Oct. 27 to improve a bid for the
group's 88% stake in motorway business Autostrade per l'Italia.
    In a statement confirming what sources told Reuters earlier
on Tuesday, Atlantia said its board had examined the preliminary
offer presented by CDP and investment funds Macquarie and
Blackstone. [nL8N2HA5H2]
    CDP said late on Monday the consortium aimed to sign a
memorandum of understanding with Atlantia by Oct. 28 with a
binding offer to follow after 10-weeks of due diligence.
    But Atlantia's board decided to give CDP extra time to
submit a better offer.
    ""The board has considered the economic terms and the
conditions at this stage as not yet compliant and suitable for
ensuring a fair market valuation of its Autostrade stake,"" the
infrastructure group said.
    Atlantia said its board would meet again on Oct. 28.
    Atlantia has been embroiled in a legal dispute with Rome
since 2018, when a bridge run by Autostrade collapsed killing 43
people. The government has threatened to strip it of its
motorway licence.
    Two sources close to the matter said the offer by the
CDP-led consortium could value Autostrade at up to 9.5 billion
euros before applying a discount for the risks of future damage
claims linked to the bridge collapse and possible changes in the
company's tariff system.
    Activist fund TCI and Spinecap fund, two minority investors
in Atlantia, have said Autostrade could be worth between 11
billion and 12 billion euros.
    Last week, CDP and Atlantia began exclusive talks to try to
rescue a deal that had foundered over a series of issues
including valuation and legal liabilities.
    Atlantia needs to secure an offer it deems attractive in the
short-term or it will have to fall back on previous plans for a
spin-off of its Autostrade stake.
    The group has a shareholder meeting scheduled for Oct. 30
and will press ahead with a vote to spin off Autostrade and sell
it to institutional investors unless CDP delivers an attractive
offer in time, sources have said.
    CDP has asked Atlantia to postpone the meeting to give more
time for negotiations.
    Leading proxy advisers Glass Lewis and Institutional
Shareholder Services have recommended Atlantia's shareholders 
vote in favour of the spin-off of the motorway assets, according
to documents seen by Reuters.

    By Tim Hepher and William James
    LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The United States and Britain
expressed optimism about the prospects of a trade deal on
Tuesday as they launched the latest round of talks focused on
goods and tariffs.
    U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told a security 
conference he was ""very pleased"" with progress in negotiations
with Britain and predicted a trade deal ""reasonably soon"".
    British trade minister Liz Truss said the two sides were 
intensifying talks as they enter a fifth round. [nL8N2HB6FB]
    Britain has put a U.S. trade deal at the top of its
post-Brexit wish list, having cited the freedom to strike
bilateral deals as one of the main benefits of leaving the
European Union.
    No target date for an agreement has been set, however, and
Truss has had to rebut opposition criticism that a deal would
mean lowering food standards and allowing U.S. companies access
to the British health system.
    Lighthizer, speaking by video link from Washington to a
British government conference on transatlantic co-operation,
said talks were taking place continuously.
    ""These things take time ... but we are making great headway
and we have got 30-some groups negotiating and negotiating
bitterly right now,"" Lighthizer told the Atlantic Future Forum.
    ""I am optimistic across the board and I think that it is
going to happen reasonably soon,"" he said.
    Truss, speaking by remote link to the same conference, said
western port cities like Liverpool would benefit from a U.S.
trade deal as Britain widens its gaze beyond a 45-year-old bias
in favour of trade ties with the EU.
    The tone of the public exchange contrasted with a stand-off
between London and Brussels over Britain's future trade ties
with the EU following its exit from the bloc in January.
    The EU and Britain urged each other on Tuesday to compromise
to avoid a disruptive Brexit finale. [nL8N2HB24U]
    Lighthizer, who has named the UK trade talks one of his top
priorities for 2020, has called for full access for U.S.
agricultural products. [nL1N20O07]    
    The two sides are seen at odds, however, over tariffs
including U.S. steel and aluminium duties imposed in 2018.
    
    AIRCRAFT DISPUTE
    A growing potential flashpoint concerns Britain's close
links to jetmaker Airbus <AIR.PA>, which is at the centre of a
16-year-old transatlantic trade spat over aircraft subsidies.
    The EU has won the right to hit back with tariffs on U.S.
goods to punish U.S. subsidies to Boeing <BA.N> - a year after
Washington slapped duties on EU goods over subsidies granted to
Airbus by Britain, France, Germany and Spain. [nL8N2H44BN]
    U.S. President Donald Trump has said Washington will ""strike
back harder"" at any European tariffs.
    Analysts say Britain is squeezed between applying its share
of the tariffs in defence of Airbus and risking a setback in 
trade talks with the United States, or delaying them and further
corroding tense talks over a European trade deal.[nL8N2H33EL] 
    Without referring to recent tariff wars between the United
States and China, Truss questioned the use of tariffs but did
not address how Britain would handle the Boeing subsidies case.
    ""Even before the COVID crisis started we have seen trade
barriers going up and we have seen tariffs being raised, and
that surely is not the answer,"" Truss said.
    Lighthizer defended the right of nations to defend their
trade interests but said this did not amount to protectionism.
    ""Nationalism is not necessarily a bad thing. ... Countries
becoming stronger is not necessarily inconsistent with
international trade,"" he told the conference.
    Both officials called for an overhaul of the Geneva-based
World Trade Organization as it prepares to select a new leader. 
    ""There is no doubt that there needs to be reform at the WTO.
We need to make the global trading system work,"" Truss said.

Video Transcript:

China's top ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing is reportedly considering Hong Kong
for a multibillion-dollar initial public offering. People with knowledge of
the matter said the firm is rethinking previous aims to list in New York as a
result of rising tensions with the US. Didi is backed by technology investment
giants SoftBank, Alibaba and Tencent. And has begun generating a healthy
profit since the second quarter of the year. Some of its investors are now
thought to be keen to cash in. Three sources have told Reuters that Didi has
started initial talks with investment banks for the long-awaited IPO. The
Beijing-based company is thought to be targeting a valuation of more than $60
billion, with the listing expected in the first half of next year. Asked by
Reuters to comment, Didi said it doesn't have any ""definitive"" IPO plan or
timeline. For years the ride hailing app has aimed for a US IPO because of the
prestige of a New York listing. It would also put it alongside comparable
peers like Uber and Lyft. Uber and Didi have long-standing links: after waging
an expensive campaign to crack the Chinese market, Uber in 2016 sold its
operation to Didi in exchange for a 17.5% stake in the Chinese firm. In turn,
Didi made a $1 billion investment in Uber. If completed, the IPO would further
burnish Hong Kong's status as a global capital markets hub. Nearly $29 billion
worth of IPOs and secondary listings have been carried out in the city so far
this year.

started initial talks with investment banks for the long-awaited IPO. The
Beijing-based company is thought to be targeting a valuation of more than $60
billion, with the listing expected in the first half of next year. Asked by
Reuters to comment, Didi said it doesn't have any ""definitive"" IPO plan or
timeline. For years the ride hailing app has aimed for a US IPO because of the
prestige of a New York listing. It would also put it alongside comparable
peers like Uber and Lyft. Uber and Didi have long-standing links: after waging
an expensive campaign to crack the Chinese market, Uber in 2016 sold its
operation to Didi in exchange for a 17.5% stake in the Chinese firm. In turn,
Didi made a $1 billion investment in Uber. If completed, the IPO would further
burnish Hong Kong's status as a global capital markets hub. Nearly $29 billion
worth of IPOs and secondary listings have been carried out in the city so far
this year.

control of Transport for London (TfL) if mayor Sadiq Khan fails
to reach a deal proposed by ministers, the Financial Times
reported on Tuesday.
    Transport secretary Grant Shapps had written a letter to
Khan earlier this month listing several conditions in return for
any financial rescue package, the newspaper https://on.ft.com/31mAxan
 reported.
    According to the report, Shapps proposed a six-month funding
deal to March 2021 dubbed ""the H2 deal"" ahead of a longer-term
settlement.
    TfL's income was down by 90% because people avoided public
transportation at the height of the novel coronavirus pandemic
between March and July. It was bailed out by the central
government when its finances came under pressure in the crisis.
    The government's proposed deal offered TfL a further 1
billion pounds ($1.29 billion) bailout with demands that the
transport operator raise fares and curb the remaining free
travel entitlements for children and pensioners, a source
familiar with the matter had said on Thursday. [nL8N2H66G5]
    Shapps said the government would take control of TfL and run
it from Whitehall if both sides failed to strike an H2 deal or
if its terms were not met, the FT said. 
    Conditions such as extending a £15 congestion charge to the
North and South Circular were put forward by the minister. 
    The demands were rejected by Khan in an interview with LBC
News last week. 
    ""Negotiations with the Government continue, but suffice it
to say there is simply no way any Mayor could accept conditions
of this nature,"" a representative for the Mayor of London said
in an emailed statement on Tuesday in response to the FT report.
    TfL had announced last week that government support had been
extended for a further two weeks. [nASN000FQN]

Video Transcript:

Passenger numbers for Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways were down over 98% in
September compared with a year earlier. And things are only looking slightly
better for next year. Cathay expects to operate less than half of its
pre-pandemic passenger flight capacity in 2021. And according to a report in
the South China Morning Post on Tuesday that means major job losses. Citing
sources close to the matter, it says the airline will cut around 6,000 jobs,
or 18% of its workforce. It also reported that the firm will axe regional
brand Cathay Dragon to help it weather the coronavirus pandemic. The airline
said in June it was reviewing its strategy in light of the downturn, with
""tough decisions"" to be announced during the fourth quarter. Having received a
5-billion-dollar rescue package from the Hong Kong government in June, Cathay
has been burning through at least $193 million dollars of cash a month. The
South China Morning Post said the airline was expected to announce the job
cuts on Wednesday. It added that the figure had been reduced from 8,000
layoffs after government intervention. The newspaper said the airline will
sacrifice Cathay Dragon, but staff and resources of the two airlines would be
merged. Cathay has so far refrained from making major job cuts. But other
heavyweights in the region haven't, including Singapore Airlines and Qantas.
Cathay declined to comment on the report.

    Oct 20 (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co <CNR.TO>
<CNI.N> on Tuesday missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter
profit on Tuesday due to lower crude shipment during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
    Rail operators, which moved record-high Canadian oil volumes
at the beginning of the year, witnessed a plunge in crude
volumes as energy companies cut production in the face of
falling demand due to coronavirus-driven lockdowns. [nL2N2ET23D]
    The company's operating ratio, a closely watched measure of
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, rose to 59.9%
from 57.9%.
    However, grain and fertilizers carloads, the amount of
freight loaded into cars during a specified period, rose 12% in
the quarter as reduced shipment of crude and consumer goods has
freed up railway space, boosting movement of grains.
[nL1N2DO18J]
    Smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd <CP.TO> earlier
in the day missed Wall Street estimates as shipments declined
during the pandemic. [nL4N2HB3C4]
    On an adjusted basis, Canadian National earned C$1.38 per
share, missing analysts' average estimates of C$1.46, according
to IBES data from Refinitiv.
    Net income fell to C$985 million ($750.36 million), or
C$1.38 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from C$1.20
billion, or C$1.66 per share, a year earlier. [nGNXcblnxP]
    Revenue fell 11% to C$3.41 billion.

    Por Susan Cornwell y David Morgan
    WASHINGTON, 20 oct (Reuters) - La Casa Blanca y los
demócratas en el Congreso de Estados Unidos se acercaron el
martes a un acuerdo sobre un nuevo paquete de ayuda por el
coronavirus cuando, mientras el presidente Donald Trump dijo que
estaba dispuesto a aceptar un gran proyecto de ley de ayuda,
pese a la oposición de su propio Partido Republicano.
    Solo dos semanas antes de las elecciones presidenciales,
Trump señaló su voluntad de aceptar más de 2,2 billones de
dólares en nuevo alivio por COVID-19, como los demócratas habían
estado presionando durante meses.
    ""Quiero hacerlo aún más grande que los demócratas"", dijo
Trump en una entrevista con Fox News, mientras las
conversaciones entre Pelosi, demócrata, y el secretario del
Tesoro, Steven Mnuchin, continuaban con el objetivo de tener
algo que apruebe el Congreso antes del 3 de noviembre.
    A Pelosi, hablando con periodistas después de una llamada a
media tarde con Mnuchin, se le consultó sobre las perspectivas
de un paquete legislativo para fines de esta semana.
    ""Eso espero. Ese es el plan"", dijo. No dio detalles de su
conversación.
    Posteriormente, el asesor de alto rango de Pelosi, Drew
Hammill, afirmó que una llamada de 45 minutos entre la
presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes y Mnuchin fue
productiva ""ya que se acercaron a un acuerdo"". Hammill dijo que
las negociaciones continuarán el miércoles.
    Más temprano el martes, Pelosi afirmó a Bloomberg TV: Soy
optimista, porque creo que tenemos (...) un valor compartido de
que finalmente vamos a aplastar el virus. Con suerte para el
final del día de hoy, sabremos dónde estamos"".
    Pelosi dijo que la ayuda a los gobiernos estatales y locales
y las demandas republicanas de protección de responsabilidad
para las empresas siguen siendo puntos conflictivos.
    Pero sugirió que los demócratas podrían encontrar motivos
para acordar las protecciones de responsabilidad si el gobierno
acepta eliminar la redacción propuesta por el líder de la
mayoría republicana en el Senado, Mitch McConnell, que Pelosi
cree que eclipsaría las protecciones para los trabajadores.
    McConnell comentó que si Pelosi y la Casa Blanca llegan a un
acuerdo y la Cámara baja lo aprueba, el Senado lo consideraría.
    ""Soy consciente de que continúan las discusiones entre el
presidente y la presidenta (de la Cámara baja) sobre un paquete
más amplio"", dijo a periodistas. ""Obviamente, si eso sucediera,
tendríamos que considerarlo. Y lo consideraríamos"".
    Sin embargo, varios republicanos del Senado se mostraron
cautos, no comprometidos o simplemente negativos sobre la ayuda
de 1,8 billones de dólares o más.
    Trump, en tanto, predijo que los republicanos del Senado se
alinearían si Mnuchin y Pelosi llegan a un acuerdo bipartidista
amplio. También aseveró que estaría dispuesto a aceptar un
acuerdo aprobado principalmente con apoyo demócrata.
    ""No todos los republicanos están de acuerdo conmigo, pero lo
estarán"", dijo. Trump agregó que espera específicamente el apoyo
de McConnell: ""Estará a bordo si surge algo"".

called for new safeguards to new small passenger vessels
following a September 2019 early morning boat fire in California
that killed 34 people.
    The 75-foot recreational diving vessel, Conception, with 33
passengers and six crew aboard, was anchored off Santa Cruz
Island when it caught fire. All 33 passengers and one crew
member died of smoke inhalation because they were trapped in the
berthing area while a fire burned above.
    The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) urged all
vessels with overnight accommodations to be required to have
interconnected smoke detectors in all passenger areas and
secondary means of escape that lead into a different space than
the primary exit.
    The board also called on the U.S. Coast Guard to establish
an inspection program to verify roving patrols are conducted –
as required.
    The absence of a required roving patrol on the Conception
likely delayed the initial detection of the fire and directly
led to the high number of fatalities, the NTSB found.
    ""Our new recommendations will make these vessels safer, but
there is no rule change that can replace human vigilance,"" NTSB
Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.
    The NTSB determined the probable cause of the fire and
subsequent sinking was the failure of Truth Aquatics, the owner
and operator, to provide effective oversight of its vessel and
crew operations.
    A lawyer for the owner of the Conception did not immediately
respond to a request for comment.
    The U.S. Attorney's Office has an active criminal
investigation of the accident and the NTSB said prosecutors
asked it not to interview the captain ""out of concern that the
interview could hinder the ability of their office to bring
criminal charges against the captain.""
    The NTSB said a contributing factor was the lack of a Coast
Guard regulatory requirement for smoke detection in all
accommodation spaces.

    MEXICO CITY, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Mexican airline Aeromexico
on Tuesday posted a net loss of $130.38 million in the third
quarter under the strain of the coronavirus pandemic, yet said
passenger demand had begun to revive.
    The drag on profits was considerably narrower than in the
prior quarter, when Aeromexico posted a net loss of $1.19
billion. [nL2N2EZ2KA]
    ""In spite of the complicated environment, the market has
shown signs of recovery,"" Aeromexico said in a statement, noting
that its passenger capacity increased 68% since the second
quarter.
    Aeromexico in June began a Chapter 11 restructuring process,
becoming the third airline to file for bankruptcy protection in
Latin America, and has since received approval for up to $1
billion in financing. 
    Total revenues in the July to September period fell to 4.67
billion pesos from 18.35 billion pesos a year earlier, said
Aeromexico, which is part-owned by Delta Air Lines <DAL.N>.
    Its net loss in the quarter amounted to 2.88 billion pesos,
compared with a net profit of 65.8 billion pesos a year ago. 
        
($1 = 22.1050 pesos at end-September)

reduction)
    MEXICO CITY, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Mexican airline Aeromexico
on Tuesday posted a net loss of $130.38 million in the third
quarter under the strain of the coronavirus pandemic, yet said
passenger demand had begun to revive.
    The drag on profits was considerably narrower than in the
prior quarter, when Aeromexico posted a net loss of $1.19
billion. [nL2N2EZ2KA]
    ""In spite of the complicated environment, the market has
shown signs of recovery,"" Aeromexico said in a statement, noting
that its passenger capacity increased 68% since the second
quarter, with more than a million people taking flights,
especially domestic routes.
    The company also reduced its workforce by 96 people, after
cutting nearly 2,000 positions in the prior quarter.
    Aeromexico in June began a Chapter 11 restructuring process,
becoming the third airline to file for bankruptcy protection in
Latin America, and has since received approval for up to $1
billion in financing. 
    Total revenue in the July to September period fell to 4.67
billion pesos ($211.3 million) from 18.35 billion pesos a year
earlier, said Aeromexico, which is part-owned by Delta Air Lines
<DAL.N>.
    Its net loss in the quarter amounted to 2.88 billion pesos,
compared with a net profit of 65.8 billion pesos a year ago. 
        
($1 = 22.1050 pesos at end-September)

Airways Ltd <0293.HK> said on Wednesday it would cut 5,900 jobs
and end its regional Cathay Dragon brand as it grapples with a
plunge in demand from the coronavirus pandemic.
    The restructuring will cost HK$2.2 billion ($283.9 million)
and the airline will also seek changes in conditions in its
contracts with cabin crew and pilots, the airline told the stock
exchange.
    Overall, it will cut 8,500 positions, or 24% of its normal
headcount, but that includes 2,600 roles currently unfilled due
to cost reduction initiatives, Cathay said.
